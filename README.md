Welcome to my personal journey and guide through the Nix ecosystem! This "book"
aims to be a practical and understandable resource for anyone looking to dive
into Nix, NixOS, and Home Manager. Whether you're just getting started or
looking to deepen your understanding, I hope you find this resource helpful!

I am a technologist with a wide range of interests that I'm passionate about,
NixOS being one of them. I am also a privacy advocate trying to spread the word.
