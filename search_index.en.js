your config as well as going into more advanced outputs.\n\n\nThis is long winded, and maybe unnecessary for your workflow. Also I take notes in markdown so this is written in markdown. It demonstrates other ways to modularize your config as well as going into more advanced outputs.\n\n\nThis allows you to build your configuration as a package allowing you to separate the process of creating a configuration artifact and applying it to the live system giving you a reusable artifact that can be used to deploy to different systems. This can make it easier to isolate it from other parts of your system making debugging easier.\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't want to change the name of inputs and effect other areas of my config so I first renamed @ inputs to @ my-inputs to make the merged attribute set use the original inputs name.\n\n\nNote, I'm still using home-manager as a module I just had to move it for all modules to be available inside the artifact built with nix build .#nixos\n\n\nBenefits of nixosConfiguration as a Package\npackages.x86_64-linux.nixos = self.nixosConfigurations.magic.config.system.build.toplevel;\n\nThis exposes the toplevel derivation of nixosConfiguration.magic as a package, which is the complete system closure of your NixOS configuration.\n\nHere is the /hosts/magic/default.nix:\n\n\nBecause we want all modules, not just NixOS modules this requires changing your configuration.nix to include your home-manager configuration. The core reason for this is that the packages.nixos output builds a NixOS system, and home-manager needs to be a part of that system's definition to be included in the build.\n\n\n\n[!NOTE]: inputs.lib.nixOsModules is equivalent to ../../home in my case and imports all of my nixOS modules. This comes from the flake.nix where I have nixOsModules = import ./nixos Which looks for a default.nix in the nixos directory.\n\nMy ~/my-nixos/nixos/default.nix looks like this:\n\nUsage and Deployment\nTo build the package configuration run:\n\nAdding a Configuration VM Output\nBuilding on what we already have, add this under defaultConfig:\n\nand under the line nixos = defaultConfig.config.system.build.toplevel add:\n\nAnd in lib/vms/nixos-vm.nix:\n\n\nUncomment and add your username to auto login.\n\nAnd an apps output that will build and deploy in one step with nix build .#deploy-nixos I'll show packages and apps outputs for context:\n\nDebugging\n\nBefore switching configurations, verify what's inside your built package:\n\n\n\nExplore the Package Contents\n\nOnce the build completes, you get a store path like /nix/store/...-nixos-system. You can explore the contents using:\n\nInstead of switching, test components:\n\nLoad the flake into the repl:\n\n\nYou can make a change to your configuration while in the repl and reload with :r\n\nUnderstanding Atomicity:\n\n\nAtomicity means that a system update (e.g. changing configuration.nix or a flake-based toplevel package) either fully succeeds or leaves the system unchanged, preventing partial or inconsistent states.\n\n\nThe toplevel package is the entry point for your entire NixOS system, including the kernel, initrd, system services, and home-manager settings.\n\n\nBuilding with nix build .#nixos creates the toplevel derivation upfront, allowing you to inspect or copy it before activation:\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, nixos-rebuild switch builds and activates in one step, similar to cargo run although both do involve the same toplevel derivation.\n\nThe toplevel package can be copied to another NixOS machine:\n\n\n\nI got the examples for building your configuration as a package and vm from the hydenix configuration and adapted them to my config.\n\n\nI got the examples for building your configuration as a package and vm from the hydenix configuration and adapted them to my config.\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/building-your-configuration-as-a-package/","title":"Building your Configuration as a Package"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/comparing-flakes-to-traditional-nix/":{"body":"Introduction: Flakes and Traditional Nix\n\nThis post is based on notes from Nix-Hour #4, comparing Traditional Nix and Flakes, focusing on achieving pure build results. See the YouTube video for the original content. This guide adapts the information for clarity and ease of understanding.\n\nWhat is Purity in Nix?\n\n\nA key benefit of Nix Flakes is their default enforcement of pure evaluation.\n\n\nIn Nix, an impure operation depends on something outside its explicit inputs.

Instead of passing dependencies explicitly, your modules suddenly receive extra variables that aren't structured like normal module options.\nFirst we'll define a custom option in an inline module that has the needed dependencies in its lexical closure inside of flake.nix to inject said dependencies into our NixOS configuration. This makes those dependencies available to all modules that import this configuration, without needing to pass them explicitly via specialArgs in your flakes outputs. It's a more declarative and centralized way to share dependencies across modules.\n\n\nThis is defined within the outputs function's let block in your flake.nix:\n\n\n\nThis defines a reusable NixOS module (nixosModules.default) that creates a dep-inject option and sets it to include your flakes inputs. It automates the process of passing inputs to individual modules in your nixosConfigurations\n\n\nThis allows you to access these dependencies directly from config.dep-inject, without the need to explicitly declare them in their argument list (e.g.\n{ inputs, pkgs, lib, ... }) and promotes a more declarative approach moving away from the imperative step of explicitly passing arguments everywhere.\n\n\nThe depInject module becomes a reusable component that any NixOS configuration within your flake can import this module automatically and gain access to the injected dependencies.\n\n\nExample use:\n\nUse dep-inject in any Module\n\nIn any module that's part of this configuration, you can access the injected dependencies via config.dep-inject. You don't need to add inputs or userVars to the module's arguments.\n\nExample: System Configuration Module\n\n\n\nconfig.dep-inject.flake-inputs.nixpkgs: Accesses the nixpkgs input\n\n\nconfig.dep-inject.userVars: Access your userVars\n\n\nUnlike specialArgs, you don't need { inputs, userVars, ... }\n\n\nUse dep-inject in home-manager modules\n\n\nBy default, dep-inject is available in NixOS modules but not automatically in home-manager modules unless you either:\n\nPass dep-inject via extraSpecialArgs (less ideal)\nor\nImport the depInject module into home-managers configuration.\n\n\n\n\nUsing extraSpecialArgs\n\n\nThen in ./hosts/${host}/home.nix:\n\n\nImport depInject into home-manager:\n\n\n\n\nimports = [ self.nixosModules.default ]: Makes dep-inject available in home-managers config.\n\n\nAccess: Use config.dep-inject directly in home-manager modules, no extraSpecialArgs needed.\n\n\nThis is considered more idiomatic and as mentioned in \"flakes-arent-real\" linked below, specialArgs is uglier, since it gets dumped into the arguments for every module, which is unlike how every other bit of data flow works in NixOS, and it also doesn't work outside of the flake that's actually invoking nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem, if you try using modules outside of that particular Flake, the injected arguments won't persist.\n\n\nBy explicitly handling dependency injection in a more declarative way (e.g. config.dep-inject), you ensure that dependencies remain accessible accross different modules, regardless of where they are used.\n\n\nI don't personally use this technique for injecting dependencies in my NixOS configuration. It adds complexity that I believe specialArgs was supposed to solve and on modern computers I don't think it will matter too much. This is just another way to do things and a way to enhance understanding.\n\n\nI got this example from flakes-arent-real and built on it to enhance understanding.

Think of it as a recipe for creating something within the Nix ecosystem.\n\n\nFor beginners, the analogy of a cooking recipe is helpful:\n\nIngredients (Dependencies): What other software or libraries are needed.\nSteps (Build Instructions): The commands to compile, configure, and install.\nFinal Dish (Output): The resulting package or resource.\n\n\n\nA Nix derivation encapsulates all this information, telling Nix what inputs\nto use, how to build it, and what the final output should be.\n\n\nCreating Derivations in Nix\n\n\nThe primary way to define packages in Nix is through the mkDerivation function, which is part of the standard environment (stdenv). While a\nlower-level derivation function exists for advanced use cases,\nmkDerivation simplifies the process by automatically managing dependencies\nand the build environment.\n\n\nmkDerivation (and derivation) takes a set of attributes as its argument.\nAt a minimum, you'll often encounter these essential attributes:\n\nname: A human-readable identifier for the derivation\n(e.g., \"foo\", \"hello.txt\"). This helps you and Nix refer to the package.\nsystem: Specifies the target architecture for the build\n(e.g., builtins.currentSystem for your current machine).\nbuilder: Defines the program that will execute the build instructions\n(e.g., bash).\n\n\n\nOur First Simple Derivation: Understanding the Builder\n\nTo understand how derivations work, let's create a very basic example using a\nbash script as our builder.\n\nWhy a Builder Script?\n\nThe builder attribute in a derivation tells Nix how to perform the build\nsteps. A simple and common way to define these steps is with a bash script.\n\nThe Challenge with Shebangs in Nix\n\n\nIn typical Unix-like systems, you might start a bash script with a shebang\n(#!/bin/bash or #!/usr/bin/env bash) to tell the system how to execute it.\nHowever, in Nix derivations, we generally avoid this.\n\n\nReason: Nix builds happen in an isolated environment where the exact path\nto common tools like bash isn't known beforehand (it resides within the Nix\nstore). Hardcoding a path or relying on the system's PATH would break Nix's\nstateless property.\n\n\nThe Importance of Statelessness in Nix\n\n\nStateful Systems (Traditional): When you install software traditionally,\nit often modifies the core system environment directly. This can lead to\ndependency conflicts and makes rollbacks difficult.\n\n\nStateless Systems (Nix): Nix takes a different approach. When installing\na package, it creates a unique, immutable directory in the Nix store. This\nmeans:\n\nNo Conflicts: Different versions of the same package can coexist\nwithout interfering with each other.\nReliable Rollback: You can easily switch back to previous versions\nwithout affecting system-wide files.\nReproducibility: Builds are more likely to produce the same result\nacross different machines if they are \"pure\" (don't rely on external\nsystem state).\n\n\n\nOur builder.sh Script\n\nFor our first derivation, we'll create a simple builder.sh file in the current directory:\n\n\n\n\nThe command declare -xp lists exported variables (it's a bash builtin\nfunction).\n\n\nNix needs to know where the final built product (the \"cake\" in our earlier\nanalogy) should be placed. So, during the derivation process, Nix calculates\na unique output path within the Nix store. This path is then made available\nto our builder script as an environment variable named $out. The .drv\nfile, which is the recipe, contains instructions for the builder, including\nsetting up this $out variable. Our builder script will then put the result\nof its work (in this case, the \"foo\" file) into this specific $out directory.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier we need to find the nix store path to the bash\nexecutable, common way to do this is to load Nixpkgs into the repl\nand check:\n\n\n\nSo, with this little trick we are able to refer to bin/bash and create\nour derivation:\n\n\n\nBoom! The contents of /nix/store/w024zci0x1hh1wj6gjq0jagkc1sgrf5r-foo\nis really foo! We've built our first derivation.\n\n\nDerivations are the primitive that Nix uses to define packages. “Package”\nis a loosely defined term, but a derivation is simply the result of calling\nbuiltins.derivation.\n\n\nOur Second Derivation\nThe following is a simple hello-drv derivation:\n\n\nDerivations have a .drv suffix, as you can see the result of calling\nhello-drv is the nix store path to a derivation.\n\nLinks and short Overview\n\n\nNixPillsOurFirstDerivation\n\n\nNixPills-WorkingDerivation\n\n\nnix.dev-Derivations\n\n\nnix.dev-packagingExistingSoftware\n\n\nhowToLearnNix-MyFirstDerivation\n\n\nhowToLearnNix-DerivationsInDetail\n\n\nSparky/blog-creatingASuperSimpleDerivation # How to learn Nix\n\n\nSparky/blog-Derivations102\n\n\nScriveNixWorkshop-nixDerivationBasics\n\n\nzeroToNix-Derivations\n\n\nTweag-derivationOutputs\n\n\ntheNixLectures-Derivations\n\n\nbmcgee-whatAreFixed-OutputDerivations\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/learn-derivations/","title":"Understanding Nix Derivations: A Beginner's Guide & Resources"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/local-nixpkgs/":{"body":"Working with Nixpkgs Locally: Benefits and Best Practices\n\nNixpkgs, the package repository for NixOS, is a powerful resource for building and customizing software.\nWorking with a local copy enhances development, debugging, and contribution workflows.\nThis post covers setting up a local Nixpkgs repository, searching for dependencies, and leveraging its advantages, incorporating tips from the Nix community.\n\nI. Why Work with Nixpkgs Locally?\n\n\nA local Nixpkgs repository offers significant advantages for Nix developers:\nA. Faster Development Cycle\n\nLocal searches for packages and dependencies are significantly quicker than querying remote repositories or channels.\nThis speedup is crucial for efficient debugging and rapid prototyping of Nix expressions.\n\nB. Enhanced Version Control\n\nBy pinning your local repository to specific commits or branches (e.g., nixos-unstable), you ensure build reproducibility.\nThis prevents unexpected issues arising from upstream changes in Nixpkgs.\n\nC. Flexible Debugging Capabilities\n\nYou can directly test and modify package derivations within your local copy.\nThis allows for quick fixes to issues like missing dependencies without waiting for upstream updates or releases.\n\nD. Streamlined Contribution Workflow\n\nDeveloping and testing new packages or patches locally is essential before submitting them as pull requests to Nixpkgs.\nA local setup provides an isolated environment for experimentation.\n\nE. Up-to-Date Documentation Source\n\nThe source code and comments within the Nixpkgs repository often contain the most current information about packages.\nThis can sometimes be more up-to-date than official, external documentation.\n\nF. Optimized Storage and Performance\n\nEmploying efficient cloning strategies (e.g., shallow clones) and avoiding unnecessary practices (like directly using Nixpkgs as a flake for local development) minimizes disk usage and build times.\n\n\n\nII. Flake vs. Non-Flake Syntax for Local Nixpkgs\n\n\nWhen working with Nixpkgs locally, the choice between Flake and non-Flake syntax has implications for performance and storage:\nA. Flake Syntax (nix build .#&lt;package&gt;)\n\nTreats the current directory as a flake, requiring evaluation of flake.nix.\nFor local Nixpkgs, this evaluates the flake definition in the repository root.\nPerformance and Storage Overhead: Flakes copy the entire working directory (including Git history if present) to /nix/store for evaluation. This can be slow and storage-intensive for large repositories like Nixpkgs.\n\nB. Non-Flake Syntax (nix-build -f . &lt;package&gt; or nix build -f . &lt;package&gt;)\n\n-f . specifies the Nix expression (e.g., default.nix or a specific file) in the current directory.\nEfficiency: Evaluates the Nix expression directly without copying the entire worktree to /nix/store. This is significantly faster and more storage-efficient for local development on large repositories.\n\n\n\nIII. Setting Up a Local Nixpkgs Repository Efficiently\n\n\nCloning Nixpkgs requires careful consideration due to its size.\nA. Initial Clone: Shallow Cloning\n\nTo avoid downloading the entire history, perform a shallow clone:\n\n\nB. Managing Branches with Worktrees\n\nUse Git worktrees to manage different branches efficiently:\n\nExplanation of git worktree: Allows multiple working directories attached to the same .git directory, sharing history and objects but with separate checked-out files.\ngit worktree add: Creates a new working directory for the specified branch (nixos-unstable in this case).\n\n\n\nIV. Debugging Missing Dependencies: A Practical Example\n\n\nLet's say you're trying to build icat locally and encounter a missing dependency error:\n\n\nThe error fatal error: X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory indicates a missing X11 dependency.\n\nA. Online Search with search.nixos.org\n\nThe Nixpkgs package search website (https://search.nixos.org/packages) is a valuable first step.\nHowever, broad terms like \"x11\" can yield many irrelevant results.\nTip: Utilize the left sidebar to filter by package sets (e.g., \"xorg\").\n\nB. Local Source Code Search with rg (ripgrep)\n\n\nFamiliarity with searching the Nixpkgs source code is crucial for finding dependencies.\n\n\nNavigate to your local nixpkgs/ directory and use rg:\n\nOutput:\n\n\n\nRefining the search (case-insensitive):\n\nOutput:\n\n\n\nThe key result is xorg.libX11, which is likely the missing dependency.\n\n\n\n\nV. Local Derivation Search with nix-locate\n\n\nnix-locate (from the nix-index package) allows searching for derivations on the command line.\n\nNote: Install nix-index and run nix-index to create the initial index.\n\n\n\n\nCombining online and local search tools (search.nixos.org, rg, nix-locate) provides a comprehensive approach to finding dependencies.\n\n\nVI. Key Benefits of Working with Nixpkgs Locally (Recap)\n\nSpeed: Faster searches and builds compared to remote operations.\nControl: Full control over the Nixpkgs version.\nUp-to-Date Information: Repository source often has the latest details.\n\nVII. Best Practices and Tips from the Community\n\n\nRebasing over Merging: Never merge upstream changes into your local branch. Always rebase your branch onto the upstream (e.g., master or nixos-unstable) to avoid accidental large-scale pings in pull requests (Tip from soulsssx3 on Reddit).\n\n\nTip from ElvishJErrico: Avoid using Nixpkgs directly as a flake for local development due to slow copying to /nix/store and performance issues with garbage collection on large numbers of small files. Use nix build -f . &lt;package&gt; instead of nix build .#&lt;package&gt;.\n\n\nEdge Cases for Flake Syntax: Flake syntax might be necessary in specific scenarios, such as NixOS installer tests where copying the Git history should be avoided.\n\n\nBase Changes on nixos-unstable: For better binary cache hits, base your changes on the nixos-unstable branch instead of master. Consider the merge-base for staging branches as well.\n\n\nConsider jujutsu: Explore jujutsu, a Git-compatible alternative that can offer a more intuitive workflow, especially for large monorepos like Nixpkgs. While it has a learning curve, it can significantly improve parallel work and branch management.\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/local-nixpkgs/","title":"Working with Nixpkgs Locally: Benefits and Best Practices"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-explained/":{"body":"Nix Flakes For NixOS Configuration Explained\n\n\nThis is more intended to highlight some common gotchas and places of confusion for beginners than to be a complete guide.\n\n\nYou can think of the flake.nix as an entry point and a way of acquiring dependencies (inputs) that are required for evaluation.\n\n\nA flake is simply a source tree (e.g. git repo) containing a flake.nix that provides a standardized interface to Nix artifacts (e.g. packages, modules)\n\n\nAttribute sets are all over Nix Code, they are simply name value pairs wrapped in curly braces:\n\n\n\nOutput: \"bar\"\n\n\nNote: {} is a valid attribute set in Nix.\n\n\nFlakes have what are called top-level attributes (i.e. you can access them without using dot notation). Some top-level attributes are inputs, outputs, and nixConfig.\n\n\nFlake commands are space separation for subcommands like this: nix build, the older cli commands are written with a hyphen nix-build.\n\n\nBasic Flake Structure:\n\n\nThe flake.nix file must contain an attribute set with one required attribute - outputs - and optionally description and inputs.\n\nInputs\n\n\nYou can think of inputs as the dependencies this flake relies on.\n\n\ninputs: An attribute set specifying the dependencies of the flake where the keys are the names of your flakes dependencies, and the values are references to those other flakes. To access something from a dependency, you would typically go through inputs (i.e. inputs.helix.packages)\n\n\nThe following specifies a dependency on the nixpkgs and import-cargo repositories:\n\n\n\nEach input is fetched, evaluated and passed to the outputs function as a set of attributes with the same name as the corresponding input.\n\n\nThe special input self refers to the outputs and source tree of this flake.\n\n\nEach input is fetched, evaluated and passed to the outputs function as a set of attributes with the same name as the corresponding input.\n\n\n\n\nOutputs\n\n\nYou can think of outputs as the things your flake provides (i.e. Your configuration, packages, devShells, derivations)\n\n\nFlakes can provide arbitrary Nix values, such as packages, NixOS modules or library functions. These are called outputs. Some outputs have special meaning to certain Nix commands and therefore must be a specific type. If you look at the output schema you'll see that most expect a derivation\n\n\nShow your flakes outputs with:\n\nThis command actually takes a flake URI and prints all the outputs of the flake as a nice tree structure, mapping attribute paths to the types of values.\n\n\nBeginners might initially think that self and nixpkgs within the outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... } definition are the 'outputs' themselves. However, these are actually the input arguments (which are often called output arguments) to the outputs function. This distinction is key to grasping the outputs of a flake.\n\n\nRemember that the outputs function itself takes a single argument, which is an attribute set. Even though it looks like multiple arguments { self, nixpkgs, ... }, this syntax in Nix is destructuring that single input attribute set to extract its individual fields.\n\n\nself is a way to reference \"this\" flake. You could use self.inputs to access the inputs top-level attribute. The outputs function always receives an argument conventionally named self. This argument is a reference to the flake itself including all of it's top-level attributes. You typically use self to refer to things within your own flake. (i.e. self.packages.my-package)\n\n\n\n[!NOTE]: The ... syntax is for variadic attributes, (i.e. a varying number of attributes). If you notice most flakes have many more inputs than are explicitly listed in the input arguments this is possible because of variadic attributes.\n\nIn the following example c = 2 is an extra attribute:\n\nHowever, in the function body you cannot access the \"c\" attribute. The solution is to give a name to the given set with the @-pattern:\n\n\n\n@-patterns in the outputs function argument list provides a convenient way to bind the entire attribute set to a name (i.e. outputs = { pkgs, ... } @ inputs).\n\n\nWhen you write outputs = { pkgs, ... } @ inputs, it does the following:\n\n\nDestructures the input attribute set: It tries to extract the value associated with the key pkgs from the input attribute set and bind it to the variable pkgs. The ... allows for other keys in the input attr set to be ignored in this direct destructuring.\n\n\nBinds the entire attribute set to inputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlakes promise that the outputs of a flake should be the same regardless of the evaluator's environment. Because of this, all flake outputs that have anything to do with packages must specify the platform explicitly in some way.\n\n\nPlatform is a combination of architecture and OS. (e.g. x86_64-linux).\n\n\nlegacyPackages is designed specifically for nixpkgs. It makes it possible to work with nixpkgs arbitrary attribute format from older packages. What this means is that nixpkgs traditionally organizes packages directly under the top level (e.g. pkgs.hello), and legacyPackages provides a consistent platform-aware way to access these within the flake's structured output format.\n\n\nTo expand further, Flakes enforce a more structured way of organizing outputs. For package outputs, the expected schema typically has the platform specification as a top-level attribute (i.e. packages.x86_64-linux.my-package). This ensures that when you ask a flake for a package, it's clear which platform the package is intended for. It's kind of like an API for flakes and legacy packages to be able to work together.\n\n\n\n\nFlakes take a sole argument which is another point of confusion, how is it a sole argument if im passing { self, nixpkgs, ... }? This syntax is actually shorthand for a single argument that is an attribute set.\n\nRemember, a valid attribute set in nix is {}. { a = 1; } is an attribute set with a single value. An attribute set is simply a set of name value pairs wrapped in curly braces.(e.g. {self, nixpkgs, ... }). Notice also that in the inputs arguments commas are used and everywhere else uses semicolon ;\n\n\n\nOutputs (of the Flake): Refers to the attribute set that is returned by the outputs function.\n\n\nTo recap the outputs function takes an attribute set as its argument and returns an attribute set.\n\n\nI already covered that nixosConfigurations outputs your NixOS configuration, there can be many other types of outputs explained below.\n\n\nImports\n\n\nYou can think of import as \"evaluate the Nix expression in this file\" and return its value.\n\n\nThe import function in Nix takes a path (usually a string representating a file or directory i.e. ./lib/dev-shell.nix) and evaluates the Nix expression found at that location.\n\n\nOne point of confusion is the following:\n\n\n\n\nWith (import ./modules/desktop.nix { pkgs = nixpkgs; }) you're actually saying import the file at this location but also export nixpkgs to said file to make it available.\n\nWhen you see:\n\nYou are:\n\n\nImporting the Nix expression from ./lib/my-helpers.nix\n\n\nPassing an attribute set { pkgs = nixpkgs; } as an argument to the evaluated expression in the imported file.\n\n\nInside lib/my-helpers.nix, there will likely be a function definiton that expects an argument (often also named pkgs by convention):\n\n\n\nBy passing { pkgs = nixpkgs; } during the import, you are essentially saying: The pkgs that the code in ./lib/my-helpers.nix expects as an argument should be the nixpkgs that is available within the scope of my current flake.nix(the nixpkgs passed as an argument to the outputs function)\n\n\nWhen you use import with a path that points to a directory, Nix doesn't just try to import the directory itself (which wouldn't make sense as a Nix value). Instead, it automatically looks for a file named default.nix within that directory.\n\n\nIf a default.nix file is found inside the specified directory, Nix will then evaluate the Nix expressions within that default.nix file, just as if you had directly specified the path to default.nix in your import statement. The result of evaluating default.nix becomes the value returned by the import function.\n\n\nResources\n\n\npractical-nix-flakes\n\n\ntweag nix-flakes\n\n\nNixOS-wiki Flakes\n\n\nnix.dev flakes\n\n\nflakes-arent-real\n\n\nwombats-book-of-nix\n\n\nzero-to-nix flakes\n\n\nnixos-and-flakes-book\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-explained/","title":"Nix Flakes Explained"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-tips-and-tricks/":{"body":"Nix Flake Tips and Tricks\n\nShallow clone nixpkgs, the full Git history isn't always necessary and this can speed up build times.\n\n\nThe only issue I've had is nix-index-database not working well with the shallow clone...

Multi-argument functions are done through a series of nested single-argument functions (currying).\nArgument and function body are separated by a colon (:).\nWherever you find a colon (:) in Nix code:\n\n\nOn its left is the function argument\n\n\nOn its right is the function body. The \"function body\" is the expression evaluated when the function is called.\n\n\nFunction arguments are another way to assign names to values. Values aren't known in advance: the names are placeholders that are filled when calling the function.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nIn the above example personName is a placeholder (the argument name).\n\n\nThe actual value for personName is provided when you call the function:\n\n\n\nFunction Declarations\n\nSingle argument\n\n\n\n\nMultiple arguments via nesting (currying)\n\n\nCurrying is the process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each taking a single argument.\n\n\n\n\nNix sees the colons as separators for single-argument functions that return other functions.\n\n\nThink of this as a chain of single-argument functions:\n\nOuter Function: prefix: (name: \"${prefix}, ${name}!\")\n\n\n\nThis function takes one argument, prefix.\n\n\nIts body is the definition of another function.\n\n\n\nInner Function: name: \"${prefix}, ${name}!\"\n\n\n\nThis function (which is the result of the outer function) takes one argument, name.\n\n\nIts body is the string interpolation, which can still access the prefix from the outer function's scope.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Evaluation of this Multi-Argument Call:\nWhen you write greeting \"Hello\" \"Alice\", Nix evaluates it like this:\n\ngreeting \"Hello\"\n\n\n\nThe greeting function is called with the argument \"Hello\".\n\n\nThe outer function prefix: ... is executed, with prefix being assigned \"Hello\".\n\n\nThe result of this execution is the inner function: name: \"Hello, ${name}!\"\n\n\n\n(greeting \"Hello\") \"Alice\":\n\n\n\nThe result of the first step (the inner function) is now called with the argument \"Alice\".\n\n\nThe inner function name: \"Hello, ${name}!\" is executed, with name being assigned \"Alice\".\n\n\nThe body \"Hello, ${name}!\" is evaluated, resulting in \"Hello, Alice!\"\n\n\n\nEvery colon you see in a function definition separates a single argument (on its left) from its corresponding function body (on its right). Even when the body is another function definition.\n\n\n\nIn x: x + 1: One argument x, One colon, &amp; one body x + 1\n\n\nIn prefix: name: \"${prefix}, ${name}!\": The first colon separates prefix from the rest (name: \"${prefix}, ${name}!\"), which is the body of the first function. The second colon separates name (the argument of the inner function) from its body (\"${prefix}, ${name}!\").\n\n\nPartial Application\nBecause Nix functions are curried, you can apply arguments one at a time. This is known as partial application. When you apply a function to some, but not all, of its expected arguments, you get a new function that \"remembers\" the arguments you've already provided and is waiting for the remaining ones.\nRevisiting our greeting function:\n\nIf we only provide the prefix:\n\n\nhelloGreeting is a new function that partially applies our greeting function. This new function only requires a single argument.\n\n\n\n\nPartial application can be used for creating specialized functions. This allows you to create more specific functions from more general ones by fixing some of their arguments.\n\n\nMany higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments, like map or filter) expect functions with a specific number of arguments. Partial application allows you to adapt existing functions to fit these expectations by pre-filling some of their parameters.\n\n\nMost NixOS and home-manager modules are actually functions\nIt's important to recognize that the function paradigm is central to how NixOS and Home Manager modules are structured. Most NixOS and Home Manager modules are fundamentally functions.\n\nThese module functions typically accept a single argument, an attribute set.\n\nFor example, a simplified service module could be:\n\n\n\nHere, the entire module is a function that takes one argument: { config, lib, pkgs, ... }.\n\n\nWhen you add this module to your configuration, the module system calls this function with a specific attribute set containing the current configuration, the Nix library (lib), the available packages (pkgs), and other relevant info.\n\n\nResources\n\n\nnix.dev Nix Lang Basics\n\n\nnix pills Functions and Imports\n\n\nzero-to-nix Nix Lang\n\n\nA tour of Nix \"Functions\"\n\n\nlearn Nix in y minutes\n\n\nnoogle function library\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-functions-explained/","title":"Nix Functions Explained"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-lang-basics/":{"body":"The Nix Language\nNix as a programming language can be thought of as a kind of \"JSON, but with\nfunctions\".\nAll statements are declarative, meaning that there's no sequential flow of\ninstructions that makes up a Nix package. Instead, functions are called that\nassign values to fields in attribute sets, which in turn may get assigned to\nother values.\nHow does Nix work?\nNix is a pure, functional, lazy, declarative, and reproducible programming\nlanguage.\nConceptDescription\nPureFunctions don't cause side effects.\nFunctionalFunctions can be passed as arguments and returned as results.\nLazyNot evaluated until needed to complete a computation.\nDeclarativeDescribing a system outcome.\nReproducibleOperations that are performed twice return same results\n\n\n\nIn Nix, the process of managing software starts with package definitions. These are files written in the Nix language that describe how a particular piece of software should be built. These package definitions, when processed by Nix, are translated into derivations.\n\n\nAt its core, a derivation in Nix is a blueprint or a recipe that describes how to build a specific software package or any other kind of file or directory. It's a declarative specification of:\n\n\nInputs: What existing files or other derivations are needed as dependencies.\n\n\nBuild Steps: The commands that need to be executed to produce the desired output.\n\n\nEnvironment: The specific environment (e.g., build tools, environment variables) required for the build process.\n\n\nOutputs: The resulting files or directories that the derivation produces.\n\n\nThink of a package definition as the initial instructions, and the derivation as the detailed, low-level plan that Nix uses to actually perform the build.\"\nSyntax Basics\n\nDashes are allowed as identifiers:\n\n\n\n\na-b is parsed as an identifier, not as subtraction.\n\n\nStrings: Strings are enclosed in double quotes (\") or two single quotes ('').\n\n\n\nString Interpolation: Is a language feature where a string, path, or attribute name can contain expressions enclosed in ${ }. This construct is called interpolated string, and the expression inside is an interpolated expression.string interpolation.\nRather than writing:\n\nwhere freetype is a derivation, you could instead write:\n\nAnd the above expression will be translated to the former.\nInterpolated Expression: An expression that is interpolated must evaluate to one of the following:\n\n\na string\n\n\na path\n\n\nan attribute set that has a __toString attribute or an outPath attribute.\n\n\n__toString must be a function that takes an attribute set itself and returns a string.\n\n\noutPath must be a string\n\n\nThis includes derivations or flake inputs.\n\n\n\n\nA path in an interpolated expression is first copied into the Nix store, and the resulting string is the store path of the newly created store object.\n\nreference the empty directory in an interpolated expression:\n\nOutput: \"/nix/store/2hhl2nz5v0khbn06ys82nrk99aa1xxdw-foo\"\n\nAttribute sets are all over Nix code, they are name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces, where the names must be unique:\n\n\n\n\nAttribute names usually don't need quotes.\n\n\nList elements are separated by white space.\n\n\n\n\nThe bat.enable is called dot notation. The above command can be written a few ways:\n\n\nYou will sometimes see attribute sets with rec prepended. This allows access to attributes within the set:\n\n\nWithout rec, this command would fail because we are trying to use an attribute that is defined within this attribute set. You would get an undefined variable 'one' error.\n\nInheriting Attributes\n\nis equivalent to\n\nBoth evaluate to:\n\n\n❗: This works because x is added to the lexical scope by the let construct.\n\n\nis equivalent to:\n\nIn a let expression, inherit can be used to selectively bring specific attributes of a set into scope:\n\nis equivalent to:\n\nBoth evaluate to:\n\nFunctions:\nThe code below calls a function called my_function with the parameters 2 and\n3, and assigns its output to the my_value field:\n\nFunctions are defined using this syntax, where x and y are attributes passed\ninto the function:\n\n\nThe body of the function automatically returns the result of the function.\nFunctions are called by spaces between it and its parameters. No commas are\nneeded to separate parameters.\n\n\nThis defines a function named negate that takes one argument x and returns its logical negation (using !)\n\n\nconcat = x: y: x + y defines a function that takes two arguments, x and y, and returns their string concatenation. Notice how Nix handles multi-argument functions through currying -- it's a function that returns another function. This was a little confusing to me, I'm thinking how does it return a function if concat 1 2 returns 3...\n\n\nx: ...: This part says that concat takes one argument, which we've named x.\n\n\ny: x + y: The result of the first part isn't the final value. Instead, it's another function. This inner function takes one argument, which we've named y, and then it adds x and y.\n\n\nWhen you do concat 1 you're applying the concat function to the argument 1. This returns the inner function, where x is now fixed as 1. The inner function is essentially waiting for its y argument to be provided.\n\n\nIt's when you apply the second argument, 2, to this resulting function\n(concat 1) 2 that the addition 1 + 2 finally happens, giving us 3.\n\n\n\n\nIt's like a chain of function applications:\n\n\nconcat takes x and returns a new function.\n\n\nThis new function takes y and returns the result of x + y.\n\n\nDerivations\nAgain, a derivation is like a blueprint that describes how to build a specific software package or any other kind of file or directory.\nKey Characteristics of Derivations:\n\n\nDeclarative: You describe the desired outcome and the inputs, not the exact sequence of imperative steps. Nix figures out the necessary steps based on the builder and args.\n\n\nReproducible: Given the same inputs and build instructions, a derivation will always produce the same output. This is a cornerstone of Nix's reproducibility.\n\n\nTracked by Nix: Nix keeps track of all derivations and their outputs in the Nix store. This allows for efficient management of dependencies and ensures that different packages don't interfere with each other.\n\n\nContent-Addressed: The output of a derivation is stored in the Nix store under a unique path that is derived from the hash of all its inputs and build instructions. This means that if anything changes in the derivation, the output will have a different path.\n\n\nHello World Derivation Example:\n\n\n\n{ pkgs ? import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {} }: This is a function that takes an optional argument pkgs. We need Nixpkgs to access standard build environments like stdenv.\n\n\npkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation { ... }: This calls the mkDerivation function from the standard environment (stdenv). mkDerivation is the most common way to define software packages in Nix.\n\n\nname = \"hello-world\";: Human-readable name of the derivation\n\n\nsrc = null: No external source code for this simple example\n\n\nThe rest are the build phases and package metadata.\n\n\nTo use the above derivation, save it as a .nix file (e.g. hello.nix). Then build the derivation using:\n\n\n\nNix will execute the buildPhase and installPhase\n\n\nAfter a successful build, the output will be in the Nix store. You can find the exact path by looking at the output of the nix build command (it will be something like /nix/store/your-hash-hello-world).\n\n\nRun the \"installed\" program:\n\n\nThis will execute the hello file from the Nix store and print \"Hello, World!\".\n\nHere's a simple Nix derivation that creates a file named hello in the Nix store containing the text \"Hello, World!\":\nEvaluating Nix Files\nUse nix-instantiate --eval to evaluate the expression in a Nix file:\n\n\nNote: --eval is required to evaluate the file and do nothing else. If --eval is omitted, nix-instantiate expects the expression in the given file to evaluate to a derivation.\n\nIf you don't specify an argument, nix-instantiate --eval will try to read from default.nix in the current directory.\nResources\n\n\nnix.dev nixlang-basics\n\n\nlearn nix in y minutes\n\n\nnix onepager\n\n\nawesome-nix\n\n\nzero-to-nix nix lang\n\n\nnix-pills basics of nixlang\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-lang-basics/","title":"Nix Language Basics & Nix Constructs"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-modules-explained/":{"body":"NixOS Modules\nTL;DR: In this post I break down the NixOS module system and explain how to define options. As well as how to test modules with the repl.\nTL;DR: In this post I break down the NixOS module system and explain how to define options. I take notes in markdown so it's written in markdown (sorry old reddit). I write about things to deepen understanding, you think you know until you try to explain it to someone. Anyways, I hope this is useful.\n\nMost modules are functions that take an attribute set and return an attribute set.\n\nRefresher:\n\nAn attribute set is a collection of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces:\n\n\n\nA function with an attribute set argument:\n\n\n\nThe simplest possible NixOS Module:\n\n\nNixOS produces a full system configuration by combining smaller, more isolated and reusable components: Modules. In my opinion modules are one of the first things you should understand when learning about NixOS.\n\n\nA NixOS module defines configuration options and behaviors for system components, allowing users to extend, customize, and compose configurations declaratively.\n\n\nA module is a file containing a Nix expression with a specific structure. It declares options for other modules to define (give a value). Modules were introduced to allow extending NixOS without modifying its source code.\n\n\nTo define any values, the module system first has to know which ones are allowed. This is done by declaring options that specify which attributes can be set and used elsewhere.\n\n\nIf you want to write your own modules, I recommend setting up nixd or nil with your editor of choice. This will allow your editor to warn you about missing arguments and dependencies as well as syntax errors.\n\n\nDeclaring Options\nThe following is nixpkgs/nixos/modules/programs/vim.nix:\n\n\nIt provides options to enable Vim, set it as the default editor, and specify the Vim package to use.\n\n\nModule Inputs and Structure:\n\n\n\n\nInputs: The module takes the above inputs and ... (catch-all for other args)\n\n\nconfig: Allows the module to read option values (e.g. config.programs.vim.enable). It provides access to the evaluated configuration.\n\n\nlib: The Nixpkgs library, giving us helper functions like mkEnableOption, mkIf, and mkOverride.\n\n\npkgs: The Nixpkgs package set, used to access packages like pkgs.vim\n\n\n...: Allows the module to accept additional arguments, making it flexible for extension in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways: A NixOS module is typically a function that can include config, lib, and pkgs, but it doesn’t require them. The ... argument ensures flexibility, allowing a module to accept extra inputs without breaking future compatibility. Using lib simplifies handling options (mkEnableOption, mkIf, mkOverride) and helps follow best practices. Modules define options, which users can set in their configuration, and config, which applies changes based on those options.\n\n\nLocal Configuration Reference:\n\n\n\nThis is a local alias. Instead of typing config.programs.vim over and over, the module uses cfg.\n\n\nOption Declaration\n\n\nThis defines three user-configurable options:\n\n\nenable: Turns on Vim support system-wide.\n\n\ndefaultEditor: Sets Vim as the system's default $EDITOR.\n\n\npackage: lets the user override which Vim package is used.\n\n\n\nmkPackageOption is a helper that defines a package-typed option with a default (pkgs.vim) and provides docs + example.\n\n\nConditional Configuration\n\n\n\nThis block is only activated if either programs.vim.enable or defaultEditor is set.\n\n\nWarnings\n\n\n\nGives you a soft warning if you try to set defaultEditor = true without also enabling Vim.\n\n\nActual System Config Changes\n\n\n\nIt adds Vim to your systemPackages, sets $EDITOR if defaultEditor is true, and makes /share/vim-plugins available in the environment.\n\nThe following is a bat home-manager module that I wrote:\n\nNow I could add this to my home.nix to enable it:\n\n\n\nIf I set this option to true the bat configuration is dropped in place. If it's not set to true, it won't put the bat configuration in the system. Same as with options defined in modules within the Nixpkgs repository.\n\n\nIf I had set the default to true, it would automatically enable the module without requiring an explicit custom.batModule.enable = true; call in my home.nix.\n\n\nModule Composition\n\n\nNixOS achieves its full system configuration by combining the configurations defined in various modules. This composition is primarily handled through the imports mechanism.\n\n\nimports: This is a standard option within a NixOS or Home Manager configuration (often found in your configuration.nix or home.nix). It takes a list of paths to other Nix modules. When you include a module in the imports list, the options and configurations defined in that module become part of your overall system configuration.\n\n\nYou declaratively state the desired state of your system by setting options across various modules. The NixOS build system then evaluates and merges these option settings. The culmination of this process, which includes building the entire system closure, is represented by the derivation built by config.system.build.toplevel.\n\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nNixOS Modules and Dependency Locking with npins\nThis is the file structure:\n\nThis uses npins for dependency locking.

A\npackage definition is essentially a Nix language function. And Nix Language\nis similar to JSON with functions.\n\n\nThe derivation is the concrete build plan that Nix uses to fetch sources,\nbuild dependencies, compile code, and ultimately produce the desired output\n(the package).\n\n\nSo, the package definition is the blueprint, and the derivation is the\ndetailed plan that Nix follows to build the package.

This is because\nit's impossible for Nix to know the value before the derivation is realized.\nAfter running nix-build -A hello the compiler will give it to you:\n\n\n\n\nReplace the placeholder sha256 with sha256 = \"1kJjhtlsAkpNB7f6tZEs+dbKd8z7KoNHyDHEJ0tmhnc=\"\nin the hello.nix.\n\nBuild the Result\n\nSwaytools Package Definition\nThe following is the swaytools package definition located at nixpkgs/pkgs/tools/wayland/swaytools/default.nix part of the Nixpkgs collection:\n\n\nFunction Structure:\n\n\nThe file starts with a function that takes an attribute set as input:\n\n\n\nThese arguments are dependencies or utilities provided by Nixpkgs commonly\nused in package definitions.\n\n\nDerivation Creation:\n\n\nThe function calls buildPythonApplication, a helper function for creating\npython based packages, which produces a derivation:\n\n\n\nThis is similar to stdenv.mkDerivation but tailored for Python apps\n\n\nPackage Metadata:\n\n\n\nmeta provides additional metadata (e.g. description, license) which is standard for package defs:\n\n\n\nSource Specification:\n\n\nThe src attribute tells where to fetch the source code, using fetchFromGithub:\n\n\n\nBuild and Runtime Dependencies:\n\n\n\nnativeBuildInputs lists tools needed during the build process\n\n\npropagatedBuildInputs lists runtime deps (e.g. slurp)\n\n\n\n\nBuild Format:\n\n\n\nThe format = \"pyproject\"; attribute indicates that the packages uses a pyproject.toml file for its build configuration.\n\n\nLocation: The file is located at pkgs/tools/wayland/swaytools/default.nix\n\n\nIntegration: This package is referenced in /pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix\nlike this:\n\n\n\n\nThis allows Nix to instantiate the package by passing the required arguments (lib, setuptools, etc) from Nixpkgs.\n\nResources\n\nPackaging Existing Software\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/package-definitions/","title":"Package Definitions Explained"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/simple-service/":{"body":"Building a Custom NixOS Service with Flakes and Overlays\nTL;DR NixOS's declarative configuration and flakes make it easy to create custom services.

This toplevel option is the topmost level of the NixOS evaluation and it's what almost all options eventually end up influencing through potentially a number of intermediate options.\nAs an example:\n\n\nThe high-level option services.nginx.enable uses the lower-level option systemd.services.nginx\n\n\nWhich in turn uses the even-lower-level option systemd.units.\"nginx.service\"\n\n\nWhich in turn uses environment.etc.\"systemd/system\"\n\n\nWhich then ends up as result/etc/systemd/system/nginx.service in the top-level derivation\n\n\nSo high-level options use lower-level ones, eventually ending up at system.build.toplevel.\nHow do these options get evaluated though? That's what the NixOS module system does, which lives in the ./lib directory (in modules.nix, options.nix and types.nix). The module system can even be used without NixOS, allowing you to use it for your own option sets. Here's a simple example of this, whose toplevel option you can evaluate with:\n\n\nThe module system itself is rather complex, but here's a short overview. A module evaluation consists of a set of \"modules\", which can do three things:\n\n\nImport other modules (through imports = [ ./other-module.nix ];)\n\n\nDeclare options (through options = { ... };)\n\n\nDefine option values (through config = { ... };, or without the config key as a shorthand if you don't have imports or options)\n\n\nTo do the actual evaluation, there's these rough steps:\n\n\nRecursively collect all modules by looking at all imports statements\n\n\nCollect all option declarations (with options) of all modules and merge them together if necessary\n\n\nFor each option, evaluate it by collecting all its definitions (with config) from all modules and merging them together according to the options type.\n\n\nNote that the last step is lazy (only the options you need are evaluated) and depends on other options itself (all the ones that influence it).\nThis is the end of Infinisil's comment.\nsystem.build.toplevel The top-level option that builds the entire NixOS system. Everything else in your configuration is indirectly pulled in by this option. This is what nixos-rebuild builds and what /run/current-system points to afterwards.\nTop-level attributes are those defined directly inside the module's function, they include:\n\nImports\nOptions\nConfig\n\nIn any module that you define a top-level option any non-option attributes need to be moved under the config attribute.\nFor example:\n\nerror: Module has an unsupported attribute 'appstream' This is caused by introducing a top-level config or options attribute. Add configuration attributes immediately on the top level instead, or move all of them into the explicit config attribute.\n\nThe environment.systemPackages and appstream.enable don't declare any options, they assign values to the options so they need to be moved under the config attribute like so:\n\n\n\n\nThis lets Nix know that you're not declaring an option, but rather setting/defining them.\n\n\nOtherwise, if you don't have either config or option you can just have them at the top-level, and it will implicitely put all of them under the config section.\n\n\nIf you remove the option, the config = { environment.systemPackages will still work.\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/top-level-attributes/","title":"Top-Level Attributes"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/using-overlays-to-add-packages/":{"body":"Using Overlays to add Packages that aren't in Nixpkgs\nIt is very common to use overlays in Nix to install packages that aren't available in the standard Nixpkgs repository.\n\n\nOverlays are one of the primary and recommended ways to extend and customize your Nix environment. It's important to remember that Nix overlays are made to allow you to modify or extend the package set provided by Nixpkgs (or other Nix sources) without directly altering the original package definitions. This is crucial for maintaining reproducibility and avoiding conflicts. Overlays are essentially functions that take the previous package set and allow you to add, modify, or remove packages.\n\n\nIt may be helpful to first read my Nix Flakes Tips&amp;Tricks post first to understand the outputs in my flake.\n\n\nI'll show the process of adding the pokego package that is not in Nixpkgs:\n\nIn my flake.nix I have a custom inputs variable within my let block of my flake like so just showing the necessary parts for berevity:\n\n\n\nIn the overlay.nix I have this helper function and the defined package:\n\n\n\n_final: prev:: This is the function definition of the overlay.\n\n\n\n_final: This argument represents the final, merged package set after all overlays have been applied. It's often unused within a single overlay, hence the _ prefix (a Nix convention for unused variables).\n\n\nprev: This is the crucial argument. It represents the package set before this overlay is applied. This allows you to refer to existing packages and functions from Nixpkgs.\n\n\n\n\nlet ... in packages: This introduces a let expression, which defines local variables within the scope of this overlay function. The in packages part means that the overlay function will ultimately return the packages attribute set defined within the let block.\n\n\ncallPackage = prev.lib.callPackageWith (prev // packages): This line defines a helper function called callPackage.\n\n\n\n\nprev.lib.callPackageWith Is a function provided by Nixpkgs' lib. callPackageWith is like prev.lib.callPackage, but allows the passing of additional arguments that will then be passed to the package definition.\n\n\n(prev // packages): This is an attribute set merge operation. It takes the prev package set (Nixpkgs before this overlay) and merges it with the packages attribute set defined later in this overlay.\n\n\nBy using callPackageWith with this merged attribute set, the callPackage function defined here is set up to correctly import package definitions, ensuring they have access to both the original Nixpkgs and any other packages defined within this overlay.\n\n\n\n\npackages = { ... };: This defines an attribute set named packages. This set will contain all the new or modified packages introduced by this overlay.\n\n\npokego = callPackages ./pac_defs/pokego.nix { };: This is the core of how the pokego package is added.\n\n\n\n\npokego =: This defines a new attribute named pokego within the packages attribute set. This name will be used to refer to the pokego package later.\n\n\ncallPackage ./pac_defs/pokego.nix {}: This calls the callPackage helper function defined earlier.\n\n./pac_defs/pokego.nix: This is the path to another Nix file (pokego.nix) that contains the actual package definition for pokego. This file would define how to fetch, build, and install the pokego software (similar to the hello.nix example you saw earlier).\n{}: This is an empty attribute set passed as additional arguments to the pokego.nix package definition. If pokego.nix expected any specific parameters (like versions or dependencies), you would provide them here. Since it's empty, it implies pokego.nix either has no required arguments or uses default values.\n\n\n\n\nin packages: As mentioned earlier, the overlay function returns the packages attribute set. When this overlay is applied, the packages defined within this packages set (including pokego) will be added to the overall Nix package set.\n\nThe pokego Package definition\nThe following is the ./pac_defs/pokego.nix, it may be helpful to first read my Package Definitions Explained post to better understand the following:\n\nAdding the overlay to your configuration\nThere are a few places you could choose to put the following, I choose to use my configuration.nix because of my setup:\n\nInstalling Pokego\n\nIf you are managing your entire system configuration with NixOS, you would typically add pokego to your environment.systemPackages.\n\n\n\nIf you prefer home-manager you can install pokego with home-manager also:\n\n\nAnother Overlay Example\n\n\n\nNormally, pkgs = import nixpkgs { }`` imports Nixpkgs with default settings. However, the example above customizes this import by passing arguments: pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; overlays = [ nix.overlays.default];}`. This makes the pkgs variable represent nixpkgs specifically for the aarch64-darwin system, with the overlay from the nix flake applied.\n\n\nConsequently, any packages built using this customized pkgs will now depend on or use the specific nix version (2.17.0) provided by the nix flake, instead of the version that comes with the fetched nixpkgs. This technique can be useful for ensuring a consistent environment or testing specific package versions.\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/using-overlays-to-add-packages/","title":"Using Overlays to add Packages that aren't in Nixpkgs"}},"docInfo":{"https://saylesss88.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/building-your-configuration-as-a-package/":{"body":330,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/comparing-flakes-to-traditional-nix/":{"body":272,"title":6},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/conditional-modules/":{"body":120,"title":2},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/declarative-dependency-injection/":{"body":353,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/intro-to-jujutsu-vcs/":{"body":288,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/learn-derivations/":{"body":450,"title":6},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/local-nixpkgs/":{"body":628,"title":6},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-explained/":{"body":762,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-tips-and-tricks/":{"body":240,"title":4},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-functions-explained/":{"body":445,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-lang-basics/":{"body":766,"title":5},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-modules-explained/":{"body":624,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-repl-tips/":{"body":166,"title":2},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/overlay-resources/":{"body":29,"title":2},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/package-definitions/":{"body":337,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/simple-service/":{"body":127,"title":6},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/top-level-attributes/":{"body":303,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/using-overlays-to-add-packages/":{"body":459,"title":6}},"length":20},"lang":"English"}
