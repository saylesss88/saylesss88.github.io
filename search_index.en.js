Package\n\nBenefits of nixosConfiguration as a Package\nUsage and Deployment\nAdding a Configuration VM Output\n\nDebugging\nUnderstanding Atomicity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- TL;DR This post demonstrates other ways to modularize your config as well as\n  going into more advanced outputs.\n\nThis allows you to build your configuration as a package allowing you to\nseparate the process of creating a configuration artifact and applying it to\nthe live system giving you a reusable artifact that can be used to deploy to\ndifferent systems. This can make it easier to isolate it from other parts of\nyour system making debugging easier.\n\nThe following is a snip of my flake.nix:\n\n\n\nI didn't want to change the name of inputs and effect other areas of my\nconfig so I first renamed @ inputs to @ my-inputs to make the merged\nattribute set use the original inputs name.\n\n\nNote, I'm still using home-manager as a module I just had to move it for all\nmodules to be available inside the artifact built with nix build .#nixos\n\n\nBenefits of nixosConfiguration as a Package\npackages.x86_64-linux.nixos = self.nixosConfigurations.magic.config.system.build.toplevel;\n\nThe above expression exposes the toplevel derivation of\nnixosConfiguration.magic as a package, which is the complete system closure\nof your NixOS configuration.\n\nHere is the /hosts/magic/default.nix:\n\n\nBecause we want all modules, not just NixOS modules this requires changing\nyour configuration.nix to include your home-manager configuration.

This method makes dependencies accessible to all importing modules without\nrelying on explicit specialArgs in your flake's outputs.\nDefining the dep-inject Module in flake.nix\nWithin the outputs function's let block in your flake.nix, define the\nfollowing module:\n\n\n\nThis code defines a reusable NixOS module (nixosModules.default).\n\n\nThis module creates a dep-inject option, which is an attribute set\ncontaining your flake's inputs and other relevant variables.\n\n\nBy importing depInject, configurations automatically gain access to these\ndependencies.\n\n\nBenefits of this Approach\n\n\nDeclarative Dependency Flow: Encourages a more declarative style by\naccessing dependencies through a well-defined option (config.dep-inject)\nrather than implicit arguments.\n\n\nCentralized Dependency Management: Defines dependencies in one place\n(flake.nix), making it easier to manage and update them.\n\n\nAutomatic Availability: Modules importing the configuration automatically\nhave access to the injected dependencies.\n\n\nReduced Boilerplate: Avoids the need to explicitly include dependency\narguments ({ inputs, userVars, ... }) in every module.\n\n\nExample Usage\nHere's a practical example of how this dep-inject module is defined and used\nwithin a flake.nix:\n\nUsing dep-inject in Modules\nOnce the dep-inject module is imported, you can access the injected\ndependencies within any module via config.dep-inject.\nExample: System Configuration Module (configuration.nix)\n\n\n\nconfig.dep-inject.flake-inputs.nixpkgs: Accesses the nixpkgs input.\n\n\nconfig.dep-inject.userVars: Accesses your userVars.\n\n\nYou no longer need to explicitly declare { inputs, userVars, ... } in the\nmodule's arguments.\n\n\nApplying dep-inject to Home Manager Modules\nBy default, the dep-inject module is available to NixOS modules but not\nautomatically to Home Manager modules. There are two main ways to make it\naccessible:\n\nUsing extraSpecialArgs (Less Ideal)\n\n\nThen, in your Home Manager configuration (./hosts/${host}/home.nix):\n\n\nImporting depInject into Home Manager Configuration (More Idiomatic)\n\n\n\n\nBy adding imports = [ self.nixosModules.default ]; within the Home Manager\nuser configuration, the dep-inject option becomes available under config.\n\n\nThis approach is generally considered more idiomatic and avoids the issues\nassociated with specialArgs, as highlighted in resources like\n\"flakes-arent-real\"\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile specialArgs offers a seemingly straightforward way to inject\ndependencies, this declarative approach using a custom dep-inject option\npromotes a cleaner, more structured, and potentially more robust method for\nmanaging dependencies across your NixOS modules. It aligns better with NixOS's\ndeclarative principles and can enhance the maintainability and\nunderstandability of your configuration.\nDisclaimer\n\nI don't currently personally use this technique in my configuration, it adds\ncomplexity that specialArgs aimed to solve. However, presenting this\nalternative enhances understanding of different dependency injection methods\nin Nix Flakes.

Grasping how they work is crucial for understanding and writing Nix expressions.\nThe Single-Argument Nature of Nix Functions\nA key concept to understand is that in Nix, every function conceptually takes exactly one argument. What might appear as multi-argument functions are actually achieved through a technique called currying, where a series of nested single-argument functions are used.\nIdentifying Function Structure The Colon\nThe colon (:) acts as a clear separator within a function definition:\n\nLeft of the Colon: This is the function's argument. It's a placeholder name for a value that will be provided when the function is called.\nRight of the Colon: This is the function body. It's the expression that will be evaluated when the function is invoked.\n\nThink of function arguments as naming values that aren't known in advance. These names are placeholders that get filled with specific values when the function is used.\nExample:\n\n\n\nHere, personName is the argument (the placeholder).\n\n\n\"Hello, ${personName}!\", is the function body (the expression that\nuses the placeholder).\n\n\nWhen you call the function:\n\nThe value \"Anonymous\" is substituted for the personName placeholder within\nthe function body.\nFunction Declarations Single and \"Multiple\" Arguments\nSingle-Argument Functions\nThe simplest form of a Nix function takes a single argument:\n\n\n\nx is the argument.\n\n\nx + 1 is the function body.\n\n\nSimulating Multiple Arguments: Currying\nTo create functions that appear to take multiple arguments, Nix uses currying.\nThis involves nesting single-argument functions, where each function takes one\nargument and returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on.\n\nNix interprets the colons as separators for this chain of single-argument\nfunctions.\nUnderstanding the Chain:\nConsider the greeting function:\n\nThis is effectively a chain:\n\nOuter Function: prefix: (name: \"${prefix}, ${name}!\")\n\n\n\nTakes one argument: prefix.\n\n\nIts body is another function definition: name: \"${prefix}, ${name}!\".\n\n\n2 Inner Function: name: \"${prefix}, ${name}!\"\n\n\nTakes one argument: name.\n\n\nIts body uses both its own argument (name) and the argument from the\nouter function's scope (prefix).\n\n\nStep-by-Step Evaluation:\nWhen you call greeting \"Hello\" \"Alice\":\n\ngreeting \"Hello\":\n\n\n\nThe greeting function is called with \"Hello\" as the prefix.\n\n\nThe outer function returns the inner function:\nname: \"Hello, ${name}!\" (where prefix is now fixed as `\"Hello\"`` in its\nscope).\n\n\n\n(greeting \"Hello\") \"Alice\":\n\n\n\nThe resulting inner function is then called with \"Alice\" as the name.\n\n\nThe inner function evaluates its body: \"Hello, ${\"Alice\"}!\", resulting in\n\"Hello, Alice!\".\n\n\nKey Insight: Every colon in a function definition separates a single\nargument from its function body, even if that body is another function\ndefinition.\nPartial Application: Using Functions Incrementally\nBecause of currying, you can apply arguments to a Nix function one at a time.\nThis is called partial application. When you provide only some of the expected\narguments, you get a new function that \"remembers\" the provided arguments and\nwaits for the rest.\nExample:\nUsing our greeting function again:\n\nIf we only provide the prefix:\n\n\nhelloGreeting is now a new function. It has already received the prefix\nargument (\"Hello\") and is waiting for the name argument.\n\nCalling helloGreeting:\n\nBenefits of Partial Application:\n\n\nCreating Specialized Functions: You can create more specific functions\nfrom general ones by fixing some of their parameters.\n\n\nAdapting to Higher-Order Functions: Many functions that operate on other\nfunctions (like map and filter) expect functions with a certain number of\narguments. Partial application allows you to adapt existing functions to fit\nthese requirements.\n\n\nThe Function Nature of NixOS and Home Manager Modules\nIt's crucial to understand that most NixOS and Home Manager modules are\nfundamentally functions.\n\nThese module functions typically accept a single argument: an\nattribute set.\n\nExample:\nA simplified Nginx service module:\n\n\n\nThe entire module definition is a function that takes one argument:\n{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }.\n\n\nWhen this module is included in your configuration, the NixOS module system\ncalls this function with a specific attribute set. This attribute set contains\nthe current system configuration (config), the Nix standard library (lib),\nthe available packages (pkgs), and other relevant information. The module\nthen uses these values to define parts of your system.\n\n\nResources\n\n\nnix.dev Nix Lang Basics\n\n\nnix pills Functions and Imports\n\n\nzero-to-nix Nix Lang\n\n\nA tour of Nix \"Functions\"\n\n\nlearn Nix in y minutes\n\n\nnoogle function library\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/functionsexplained/","title":"Understanding Nix Functions"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/intro-to-jujutsu-vcs/":{"body":"Intro to Jujutsu (Using jj in an existing Git Repo)\nTOC\n\nIntro to Jujutsu (Using jj in an existing Git Repo)\n\nJJ and Git Side by Side\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use jujutsu (jj) with existing Git repositories with one command.\njj git init --colocate or jj git init --git-repo /path/to/git_repository.\nThe native repository format for jj is still a work in progress so people\ntypically use a git repository for backend.\n\n\nUnlike git, jj has no index \"staging area\".

Think of it as a recipe for creating something within the Nix ecosystem.\n\n\nFor beginners, the analogy of a cooking recipe is helpful:\n\nIngredients (Dependencies): What other software or libraries are needed.\nSteps (Build Instructions): The commands to compile, configure, and install.\nFinal Dish (Output): The resulting package or resource.\n\n\n\nA Nix derivation encapsulates all this information, telling Nix what inputs\nto use, how to build it, and what the final output should be.\n\n\nCreating Derivations in Nix\n\n\nThe primary way to define packages in Nix is through the mkDerivation function, which is part of the standard environment (stdenv). While a\nlower-level derivation function exists for advanced use cases,\nmkDerivation simplifies the process by automatically managing dependencies\nand the build environment.\n\n\nmkDerivation (and derivation) takes a set of attributes as its argument.\nAt a minimum, you'll often encounter these essential attributes:\n\nname: A human-readable identifier for the derivation\n(e.g., \"foo\", \"hello.txt\"). This helps you and Nix refer to the package.\nsystem: Specifies the target architecture for the build\n(e.g., builtins.currentSystem for your current machine).\nbuilder: Defines the program that will execute the build instructions\n(e.g., bash).\n\n\n\nOur First Simple Derivation: Understanding the Builder\n\nTo understand how derivations work, let's create a very basic example using a\nbash script as our builder.\n\nWhy a Builder Script?\n\nThe builder attribute in a derivation tells Nix how to perform the build\nsteps. A simple and common way to define these steps is with a bash script.\n\nThe Challenge with Shebangs in Nix\n\n\nIn typical Unix-like systems, you might start a bash script with a shebang\n(#!/bin/bash or #!/usr/bin/env bash) to tell the system how to execute it.\nHowever, in Nix derivations, we generally avoid this.\n\n\nReason: Nix builds happen in an isolated environment where the exact path\nto common tools like bash isn't known beforehand (it resides within the Nix\nstore). Hardcoding a path or relying on the system's PATH would break Nix's\nstateless property.\n\n\nThe Importance of Statelessness in Nix\n\n\nStateful Systems (Traditional): When you install software traditionally,\nit often modifies the core system environment directly. This can lead to\ndependency conflicts and makes rollbacks difficult.\n\n\nStateless Systems (Nix): Nix takes a different approach. When installing\na package, it creates a unique, immutable directory in the Nix store. This\nmeans:\n\nNo Conflicts: Different versions of the same package can coexist\nwithout interfering with each other.\nReliable Rollback: You can easily switch back to previous versions\nwithout affecting system-wide files.\nReproducibility: Builds are more likely to produce the same result\nacross different machines if they are \"pure\" (don't rely on external\nsystem state).\n\n\n\nOur builder Script\n\nFor our first derivation, we'll create a simple builder.sh file in the current directory:\n\n\n\n\nThe command declare -xp lists exported variables (it's a bash builtin\nfunction).\n\n\nNix needs to know where the final built product (the \"cake\" in our earlier\nanalogy) should be placed. So, during the derivation process, Nix calculates\na unique output path within the Nix store. This path is then made available\nto our builder script as an environment variable named $out. The .drv\nfile, which is the recipe, contains instructions for the builder, including\nsetting up this $out variable. Our builder script will then put the result\nof its work (in this case, the \"foo\" file) into this specific $out directory.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier we need to find the nix store path to the bash\nexecutable, common way to do this is to load Nixpkgs into the repl\nand check:\n\n\n\nSo, with this little trick we are able to refer to bin/bash and create\nour derivation:\n\n\n\nBoom! The contents of /nix/store/w024zci0x1hh1wj6gjq0jagkc1sgrf5r-foo\nis really foo! We've built our first derivation.\n\n\nDerivations are the primitive that Nix uses to define packages. “Package”\nis a loosely defined term, but a derivation is simply the result of calling\nbuiltins.derivation.\n\n\nOur Second Derivation\nThe following is a simple hello-drv derivation:\n\n\nDerivations have a .drv suffix, as you can see the result of calling\nhello-drv is the nix store path to a derivation.\n\nLinks To Articles about Derivations\n\n\nNixPillsOurFirstDerivation\n\n\nNixPills-WorkingDerivation\n\n\nnix.dev-Derivations\n\n\nnix.dev-packagingExistingSoftware\n\n\nhowToLearnNix-MyFirstDerivation\n\n\nhowToLearnNix-DerivationsInDetail\n\n\nSparky/blog-creatingASuperSimpleDerivation # How to learn Nix\n\n\nSparky/blog-Derivations102\n\n\nScriveNixWorkshop-nixDerivationBasics\n\n\nzeroToNix-Derivations\n\n\nTweag-derivationOutputs\n\n\ntheNixLectures-Derivations\n\n\nbmcgee-whatAreFixed-OutputDerivations\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/learn-derivations/","title":"Understanding Nix Derivations: A Beginner's Guide & Resources"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/local-nixpkgs/":{"body":"TOC\n\n\nWorking with Nixpkgs Locally: Benefits and Best Practices\nI.

Best Practices and Tips from the Community\n\n\n\nWorking with Nixpkgs Locally: Benefits and Best Practices\n\nNixpkgs, the package repository for NixOS, is a powerful resource for building and customizing software.\nWorking with a local copy enhances development, debugging, and contribution workflows.\nThis post covers setting up a local Nixpkgs repository, searching for dependencies, and leveraging its advantages, incorporating tips from the Nix community.\n\nI. Why Work with Nixpkgs Locally?\n\n\nA local Nixpkgs repository offers significant advantages for Nix developers:\nA. Faster Development Cycle\n\nLocal searches for packages and dependencies are significantly quicker than querying remote repositories or channels.\nThis speedup is crucial for efficient debugging and rapid prototyping of Nix expressions.\n\nB. Enhanced Version Control\n\nBy pinning your local repository to specific commits or branches (e.g., nixos-unstable), you ensure build reproducibility.\nThis prevents unexpected issues arising from upstream changes in Nixpkgs.\n\nC. Flexible Debugging Capabilities\n\nYou can directly test and modify package derivations within your local copy.\nThis allows for quick fixes to issues like missing dependencies without waiting for upstream updates or releases.\n\nD. Streamlined Contribution Workflow\n\nDeveloping and testing new packages or patches locally is essential before submitting them as pull requests to Nixpkgs.\nA local setup provides an isolated environment for experimentation.\n\nE. Up-to-Date Documentation Source\n\nThe source code and comments within the Nixpkgs repository often contain the most current information about packages.\nThis can sometimes be more up-to-date than official, external documentation.\n\nF. Optimized Storage and Performance\n\nEmploying efficient cloning strategies (e.g., shallow clones) and avoiding unnecessary practices (like directly using Nixpkgs as a flake for local development) minimizes disk usage and build times.\n\n\n\nII. Flake vs. Non-Flake Syntax for Local Nixpkgs\n\n\nWhen working with Nixpkgs locally, the choice between Flake and non-Flake syntax has implications for performance and storage:\nA. Flake Syntax (nix build .#&lt;package&gt;)\n\nTreats the current directory as a flake, requiring evaluation of flake.nix.\nFor local Nixpkgs, this evaluates the flake definition in the repository root.\nPerformance and Storage Overhead: Flakes copy the entire working directory (including Git history if present) to /nix/store for evaluation. This can be slow and storage-intensive for large repositories like Nixpkgs.\n\nB. Non-Flake Syntax (nix-build -f . &lt;package&gt; or nix build -f . &lt;package&gt;)\n\n-f . specifies the Nix expression (e.g., default.nix or a specific file) in the current directory.\nEfficiency: Evaluates the Nix expression directly without copying the entire worktree to /nix/store. This is significantly faster and more storage-efficient for local development on large repositories.\n\n\n\nIII. Setting Up a Local Nixpkgs Repository Efficiently\n\n\nCloning Nixpkgs requires careful consideration due to its size.\nA. Initial Clone: Shallow Cloning\n\nTo avoid downloading the entire history, perform a shallow clone:\n\n\nB. Managing Branches with Worktrees\n\nUse Git worktrees to manage different branches efficiently:\n\nExplanation of git worktree: Allows multiple working directories attached to the same .git directory, sharing history and objects but with separate checked-out files.\ngit worktree add: Creates a new working directory for the specified branch (nixos-unstable in this case).\n\n\n\nIV. Debugging Missing Dependencies: A Practical Example\n\n\nLet's say you're trying to build icat locally and encounter a missing dependency error:\n\n\nThe error fatal error: X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory indicates a missing X11 dependency.\n\nA. Online Search with search.nixos.org\n\nThe Nixpkgs package search website (https://search.nixos.org/packages) is a valuable first step.\nHowever, broad terms like \"x11\" can yield many irrelevant results.\nTip: Utilize the left sidebar to filter by package sets (e.g., \"xorg\").\n\nB. Local Source Code Search with rg (ripgrep)\n\n\nFamiliarity with searching the Nixpkgs source code is crucial for finding dependencies.\n\n\nNavigate to your local nixpkgs/ directory and use rg:\n\nOutput:\n\n\n\nRefining the search (case-insensitive):\n\nOutput:\n\n\n\nThe key result is xorg.libX11, which is likely the missing dependency.\n\n\n\n\nV. Local Derivation Search with nix-locate\n\n\nnix-locate (from the nix-index package) allows searching for derivations on the command line.\n\nNote: Install nix-index and run nix-index to create the initial index.\n\n\n\n\nCombining online and local search tools (search.nixos.org, rg, nix-locate) provides a comprehensive approach to finding dependencies.\n\n\nVI. Key Benefits of Working with Nixpkgs Locally (Recap)\n\nSpeed: Faster searches and builds compared to remote operations.\nControl: Full control over the Nixpkgs version.\nUp-to-Date Information: Repository source often has the latest details.\n\nVII. Best Practices and Tips from the Community\n\n\nRebasing over Merging: Never merge upstream changes into your local branch. Always rebase your branch onto the upstream (e.g., master or nixos-unstable) to avoid accidental large-scale pings in pull requests (Tip from soulsssx3 on Reddit).\n\n\nTip from ElvishJErrico: Avoid using Nixpkgs directly as a flake for local development due to slow copying to /nix/store and performance issues with garbage collection on large numbers of small files. Use nix build -f . &lt;package&gt; instead of nix build .#&lt;package&gt;.\n\n\nEdge Cases for Flake Syntax: Flake syntax might be necessary in specific scenarios, such as NixOS installer tests where copying the Git history should be avoided.\n\n\nBase Changes on nixos-unstable: For better binary cache hits, base your changes on the nixos-unstable branch instead of master. Consider the merge-base for staging branches as well.\n\n\nConsider jujutsu: Explore jujutsu, a Git-compatible alternative that can offer a more intuitive workflow, especially for large monorepos like Nixpkgs. While it has a learning curve, it can significantly improve parallel work and branch management.\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/local-nixpkgs/","title":"Working with Nixpkgs Locally: Benefits and Best Practices"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-explained/":{"body":"Nix Flakes Explained\nTOC\n\n\nNix Flakes Explained\n\nWhat is a Nix Flake?\nKey Concepts\nAttribute Sets: The Building Blocks - Further Resources\n\n\n\n\n\nThis explanation highlights common areas of confusion for those new to Nix\nFlakes, aiming to clarify concepts rather than serve as a comprehensive guide.\nWhat is a Nix Flake?\n\n\nAt its core, a flake is a source tree (like a Git repository) that contains\na flake.nix file. This file provides a standardized way to access Nix\nartifacts such as packages and modules.\n\n\nThink of flake.nix as the central entry point of a flake. It not only\ndefines what the flake produces but also declares its dependencies.\n\n\nKey Concepts\n** flake.nix: The Heart of a Flake**\n\nThe flake.nix file is mandatory for any flake. It must contain an attribute\nset with at least one required attribute: outputs. It can also optionally\ninclude description and inputs.\nBasic Structure:\n\n\nAttribute Sets: The Building Blocks\n\n\nAttribute sets are fundamental in Nix. They are simply collections of\nname-value pairs wrapped in curly braces {}.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\n\n\nTop-Level Attributes of a Flake:\n\nFlakes have specific top-level attributes that can be accessed directly\n(without dot notation). The most common ones are inputs, outputs,\nand nixConfig.\n\n\n\nAnatomy of flake.nix\ninputs: Declaring Dependencies\n\n\nThe inputs attribute set specifies the other flakes that your current\nflake depends on.\n\n\nEach key in the inputs set is a name you choose for the dependency, and\nthe value is a reference to that flake (usually a URL or a Git Repo).\n\n\nTo access something from a dependency, you generally go through the inputs\nattribute (e.g., inputs.helix.packages).\n\nExample: This declares dependencies on the nixpkgs and import-cargo\nflakes:\n\n\n\n\nWhen Nix evaluates your flake, it fetches and evaluates each input. These\nevaluated inputs are then passed as an attribute set to the outputs function,\nwith the keys matching the names you gave them in the inputs set.\n\n\nThe special input self is a reference to the outputs and the source tree of\nthe current flake itself.\n\n\n\n\noutputs: Defining What Your Flake Provides\n\n\nThe outputs attribute defines what your flake makes available. This can\ninclude packages, NixOS modules, development environments (devShells) and\nother Nix derivations.\n\n\nFlakes can output arbitrary Nix values. However, certain outputs have\nspecific meanings for Nix commands and must adhere to particular types\n(often derivations, as described in the\noutput schema).\n\n\nYou can inspect the outputs of a flake using the command:\n\n\n\n\nThis command takes a flake URI and displays its outputs in a tree structure,\nshowing the attribute paths and their corresponding types.\n\nUnderstanding the outputs Function\n\n\nBeginners often mistakenly think that self and nixpkgs within\noutputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... }: { ... } are the outputs themselves.\nInstead, they are the input arguments (often called output arguments)\nto the outputs function.\n\n\nThe outputs function in flake.nix always takes a single argument,\nwhich is an attribute set. The syntax { self, nixpkgs, ... } is Nix's\nway of destructuring this single input attribute set to extract the values\nassociated with the keys self and nixpkgs.\n\n\nReferencing the Current Flake (self)\n\n\nself provides a way to refer back to the current flake from within the\noutputs function. You can use it to access other top-level attributes like\ninputs (e.g., self.inputs).\n\n\nThe outputs function always receives an argument conventionally named self,\nwhich represents the entire flake, including all its top-level attributes.\nYou'll typically use self to reference things defined within your own flake\n(e.g., self.packages.my-package).\n\n\nVariadic Attributes (...) and @-patterns\n\n\nThe ... syntax in the input arguments of the outputs function indicates\nvariadic attributes, meaning the input attribute set can contain more\nattributes than just those explicitly listed (like self and nixpkgs).\nExample:\n\nHowever, you cannot directly access these extra attributes within the\nfunction body unless you use the @-pattern:\n\n\n\nWhen used in the outputs function argument list (e.g.,\noutputs = { pkgs, ... } @ inputs), the @-pattern binds the entire input\nattribute set to a name (in this case, inputs) while also allowing you to\ndestructure specific attributes like pkgs.\n\n\nWhat outputs = { pkgs, ... } @ inputs: { ... }; does:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestructuring: It tries to extract the value associated with the key\npkgs from the input attribute set and binds it to the variable pkgs.\nThe ... allows for other keys in the input attribute set to be ignored\nduring this direct destructuring.\n\n\nBinding the Entire Set: It binds the entire input attribute set to the\nvariable inputs.\n\nExample flake.nix:\n\n\n\n\nPlatform Specificity in Outputs\n\nFlakes ensure that their outputs are consistent across different evaluation\nenvironments. Therefore, any package-related output must explicitly specify\nthe target platform (a combination of architecture and OS, x86_64-linux).\n\nlegacyPackages Explained\n\nlegacyPackages is a way for flakes to interact with the traditional,\nless structured package organization of nixpkgs. Instead of packages being\ndirectly at the top level (e.g., pkgs.hello), legacyPackages provides a\nplatform-aware way to access them within the flake's structured output format\n(e.g., nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.hello). It acts as a bridge\nbetween the flake's expected output structure and nixpkgs's historical\norganization.\n\nThe Sole Argument of outputs\n\nIt's crucial to remember that the outputs function accepts only one argument,\nwhich is an attribute set. The { self, nixpkgs, ... } syntax is simply\ndestructuring that single input attribute set.\n\nOutputs of the Flake (Return Value)\n\nThe outputs of the flake refer to the attribute set that is returned by the\noutputs function. This attribute set can contain various named outputs like\npackages, nixosConfigurations, devShells, etc.\n\nImports: Including Other Nix Expressions\n\n\nThe import function in Nix is used to evaluate the Nix expression found at\na specified path (usually a file or directory) and return its value.\n\n\nBasic Usage: import ./path/to/file.nix\n\n\nPassing Arguments During Import\n\nYou can also pass an attribute set as an argument to the Nix expression being\nimported:\n\n\n\nIn this case, the Nix expression in ./lib/my-helpers.nix is likely a\nfunction that expects an argument (often named pkgs by convention):\n\n\n\nBy passing { pkgs = nixpkgs; } during the import, you are providing the\nnixpkgs value from your current flake.nix scope to the pkgs parameter\nexpected by the code in ./lib/my-helpers.nix.\n\nImporting Directories (default.nix)\n\nWhen you use import with a path that points to a directory, Nix automatically\nlooks for a file named default.nix within that directory. If found, Nix\nevaluates the expressions within default.nix as if you had specified its\npath directly in the import statement.\n\nFurther Resources\n\n\npractical-nix-flakes\n\n\ntweag nix-flakes\n\n\nNixOS-wiki Flakes\n\n\nnix.dev flakes\n\n\nflakes-arent-real\n\n\nwombats-book-of-nix\n\n\nzero-to-nix flakes\n\n\nnixos-and-flakes-book\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-explained/","title":"Nix Flakes Explained"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-tips-and-tricks/":{"body":"Shallow Clone Nixpkgs\nTOC\n\n\nShallow Clone Nixpkgs\n\nImport your Non-Flake Wallpaper Repo\nUnderstanding @-patterns\nUnderstanding specialArgs\nSet up Flake Check and Formatter Outputs - Add a devShell Output\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShallow clone nixpkgs, the full Git history isn't always necessary and this\ncan speed up build times.\n\n\nThe only issue I've had is nix-index-database not working well with the\nshallow clone...

Instead, functions are called that\nassign values to fields in attribute sets, which in turn may get assigned to\nother values.\nHow does Nix work\nNix is a pure, functional, lazy, declarative, and reproducible programming\nlanguage.\nConceptDescription\nPureFunctions don't cause side effects.\nFunctionalFunctions can be passed as arguments and returned as results.\nLazyNot evaluated until needed to complete a computation.\nDeclarativeDescribing a system outcome.\nReproducibleOperations that are performed twice return same results\n\n\n\nIn Nix, the process of managing software starts with package definitions. These are files written in the Nix language that describe how a particular piece of software should be built. These package definitions, when processed by Nix, are translated into derivations.\n\n\nAt its core, a derivation in Nix is a blueprint or a recipe that describes how to build a specific software package or any other kind of file or directory. It's a declarative specification of:\n\n\nInputs: What existing files or other derivations are needed as dependencies.\n\n\nBuild Steps: The commands that need to be executed to produce the desired output.\n\n\nEnvironment: The specific environment (e.g., build tools, environment variables) required for the build process.\n\n\nOutputs: The resulting files or directories that the derivation produces.\n\n\nThink of a package definition as the initial instructions, and the derivation as the detailed, low-level plan that Nix uses to actually perform the build.\"\nSyntax Basics\n\nDashes are allowed as identifiers:\n\n\n\n\na-b is parsed as an identifier, not as subtraction.\n\n\nStrings: Strings are enclosed in double quotes (\") or two single quotes ('').\n\n\n\nString Interpolation: Is a language feature where a string, path, or attribute name can contain expressions enclosed in ${ }. This construct is called interpolated string, and the expression inside is an interpolated expression.string interpolation.\nRather than writing:\n\nwhere freetype is a derivation, you could instead write:\n\nAnd the above expression will be translated to the former.\nInterpolated Expression: An expression that is interpolated must evaluate to one of the following:\n\n\na string\n\n\na path\n\n\nan attribute set that has a __toString attribute or an outPath attribute.\n\n\n__toString must be a function that takes an attribute set itself and returns a string.\n\n\noutPath must be a string\n\n\nThis includes derivations or flake inputs.\n\n\n\n\nA path in an interpolated expression is first copied into the Nix store, and the resulting string is the store path of the newly created store object.\n\nreference the empty directory in an interpolated expression:\n\nOutput: \"/nix/store/2hhl2nz5v0khbn06ys82nrk99aa1xxdw-foo\"\n\nAttribute sets are all over Nix code, they are name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces, where the names must be unique:\n\n\n\n\nAttribute names usually don't need quotes.\n\n\nList elements are separated by white space.\n\n\n\n\nThe bat.enable is called dot notation. The above command can be written a few ways:\n\n\nYou will sometimes see attribute sets with rec prepended. This allows access to attributes within the set:\n\n\nWithout rec, this command would fail because we are trying to use an attribute that is defined within this attribute set. You would get an undefined variable 'one' error.\n\nInheriting Attributes\n\nis equivalent to\n\nBoth evaluate to:\n\n\n❗: This works because x is added to the lexical scope by the let construct.\n\n\nis equivalent to:\n\nIn a let expression, inherit can be used to selectively bring specific attributes of a set into scope:\n\nis equivalent to:\n\nBoth evaluate to:\n\nFunctions:\nThe code below calls a function called my_function with the parameters 2 and\n3, and assigns its output to the my_value field:\n\nFunctions are defined using this syntax, where x and y are attributes passed\ninto the function:\n\n\nThe body of the function automatically returns the result of the function.\nFunctions are called by spaces between it and its parameters. No commas are\nneeded to separate parameters.\n\n\nThis defines a function named negate that takes one argument x and returns its logical negation (using !)\n\n\nconcat = x: y: x + y defines a function that takes two arguments, x and y, and returns their string concatenation. Notice how Nix handles multi-argument functions through currying -- it's a function that returns another function. This was a little confusing to me, I'm thinking how does it return a function if concat 1 2 returns 3...\n\n\nx: ...: This part says that concat takes one argument, which we've named x.\n\n\ny: x + y: The result of the first part isn't the final value. Instead, it's another function. This inner function takes one argument, which we've named y, and then it adds x and y.\n\n\nWhen you do concat 1 you're applying the concat function to the argument 1. This returns the inner function, where x is now fixed as 1. The inner function is essentially waiting for its y argument to be provided.\n\n\nIt's when you apply the second argument, 2, to this resulting function\n(concat 1) 2 that the addition 1 + 2 finally happens, giving us 3.\n\n\n\n\nIt's like a chain of function applications:\n\n\nconcat takes x and returns a new function.\n\n\nThis new function takes y and returns the result of x + y.\n\n\nDerivations\nAgain, a derivation is like a blueprint that describes how to build a specific software package or any other kind of file or directory.\nKey Characteristics of Derivations:\n\n\nDeclarative: You describe the desired outcome and the inputs, not the exact sequence of imperative steps. Nix figures out the necessary steps based on the builder and args.\n\n\nReproducible: Given the same inputs and build instructions, a derivation will always produce the same output. This is a cornerstone of Nix's reproducibility.\n\n\nTracked by Nix: Nix keeps track of all derivations and their outputs in the Nix store. This allows for efficient management of dependencies and ensures that different packages don't interfere with each other.\n\n\nContent-Addressed: The output of a derivation is stored in the Nix store under a unique path that is derived from the hash of all its inputs and build instructions. This means that if anything changes in the derivation, the output will have a different path.\n\n\nHello World Derivation Example:\n\n\n\n{ pkgs ? import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {} }: This is a function that takes an optional argument pkgs. We need Nixpkgs to access standard build environments like stdenv.\n\n\npkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation { ... }: This calls the mkDerivation function from the standard environment (stdenv). mkDerivation is the most common way to define software packages in Nix.\n\n\nname = \"hello-world\";: Human-readable name of the derivation\n\n\nsrc = null: No external source code for this simple example\n\n\nThe rest are the build phases and package metadata.\n\n\nTo use the above derivation, save it as a .nix file (e.g. hello.nix). Then build the derivation using:\n\n\n\nNix will execute the buildPhase and installPhase\n\n\nAfter a successful build, the output will be in the Nix store. You can find the exact path by looking at the output of the nix build command (it will be something like /nix/store/your-hash-hello-world).\n\n\nRun the \"installed\" program:\n\n\nThis will execute the hello file from the Nix store and print \"Hello, World!\".\n\nHere's a simple Nix derivation that creates a file named hello in the Nix store containing the text \"Hello, World!\":\nEvaluating Nix Files\nUse nix-instantiate --eval to evaluate the expression in a Nix file:\n\n\nNote: --eval is required to evaluate the file and do nothing else. If --eval is omitted, nix-instantiate expects the expression in the given file to evaluate to a derivation.\n\nIf you don't specify an argument, nix-instantiate --eval will try to read from default.nix in the current directory.\nResources\n\n\nnix.dev nixlang-basics\n\n\nlearn nix in y minutes\n\n\nnix onepager\n\n\nawesome-nix\n\n\nzero-to-nix nix lang\n\n\nnix-pills basics of nixlang\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-lang-basics/","title":"Nix Language Basics & Nix Constructs"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-modules-explained/":{"body":"NixOS Modules\nTOC\n\n\nNixOS Modules\n\nDeclaring Options\n\nModule Composition\nNixOS Modules and Dependency Locking with npins\nResources on Modules\n\n\n\n\nVideos\n[tweagModuleSystemRecursion](#tweagmodulesystemrecursionhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvczjozohb2ow)\n\n\n\nTL;DR: In this post I break down the NixOS module system and explain how to\ndefine options. As well as how to test modules with the repl.\n\nMost modules are functions that take an attribute set and return an attribute\nset.\n\nRefresher:\n\nAn attribute set is a collection of name-value pairs wrapped in curly\nbraces:\n\n\n\nA function with an attribute set argument:\n\n\n\nThe simplest possible NixOS Module:\n\n\nNixOS produces a full system configuration by combining smaller, more isolated\nand reusable components: Modules. In my opinion modules are one of the\nfirst things you should understand when learning about NixOS.\n\n\nA NixOS module defines configuration options and behaviors for system\ncomponents, allowing users to extend, customize, and compose configurations\ndeclaratively.\n\n\nA module is a file containing a Nix expression with a specific structure.\nIt declares options for other modules to define (give a value). Modules were\nintroduced to allow extending NixOS without modifying its source code.\n\n\nTo define any values, the module system first has to know which ones are\nallowed. This is done by declaring options that specify which attributes can\nbe set and used elsewhere.\n\n\nIf you want to write your own modules, I recommend setting up\nnixd\nor nil with your editor of choice.\nThis will allow your editor to warn you about missing arguments and\ndependencies as well as syntax errors.\n\n\nDeclaring Options\nThe following is nixpkgs/nixos/modules/programs/vim.nix:\n\n\nIt provides options to enable Vim, set it as the default editor, and specify\nthe Vim package to use.\n\n\nModule Inputs and Structure:\n\n\n\n\nInputs: The module takes the above inputs and ... (catch-all for other args)\n\n\nconfig: Allows the module to read option values (e.g.\nconfig.programs.vim.enable). It provides access to the evaluated\nconfiguration.\n\n\nlib: The Nixpkgs library, giving us helper functions like mkEnableOption\n, mkIf, and mkOverride.\n\n\npkgs: The Nixpkgs package set, used to access packages like pkgs.vim\n\n\n...: Allows the module to accept additional arguments, making it flexible\nfor extension in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways: A NixOS module is typically a function that can include\nconfig, lib, and pkgs, but it doesn’t require them. The ...\nargument ensures flexibility, allowing a module to accept extra inputs\nwithout breaking future compatibility. Using lib simplifies handling\noptions (mkEnableOption, mkIf, mkOverride) and helps follow best practices.\nModules define options, which users can set in their configuration, and\nconfig, which applies changes based on those options.\n\n\nLocal Configuration Reference:\n\n\n\nThis is a local alias. Instead of typing config.programs.vim over and over,\nthe module uses cfg.\n\n\nOption Declaration\n\n\nThis defines three user-configurable options:\n\n\nenable: Turns on Vim support system-wide.\n\n\ndefaultEditor: Sets Vim as the system's default $EDITOR.\n\n\npackage: lets the user override which Vim package is used.\n\n\n\nmkPackageOption is a helper that defines a package-typed option with a\ndefault (pkgs.vim) and provides docs + example.\n\n\nConditional Configuration\n\n\n\nThis block is only activated if either programs.vim.enable or\ndefaultEditor is set.\n\n\nWarnings\n\n\n\nGives you a soft warning if you try to set defaultEditor = true without\nalso enabling Vim.\n\n\nActual System Config Changes\n\n\n\nIt adds Vim to your systemPackages, sets $EDITOR if defaultEditor is\ntrue, and makes /share/vim-plugins available in the environment.\n\nThe following is a bat home-manager module that I wrote:\n\nNow I could add this to my home.nix to enable it:\n\n\n\nIf I set this option to true the bat configuration is dropped in place. If\nit's not set to true, it won't put the bat configuration in the system. Same\nas with options defined in modules within the Nixpkgs repository.\n\n\nIf I had set the default to true, it would automatically enable the module\nwithout requiring an explicit custom.batModule.enable = true; call in my\nhome.nix.\n\n\nModule Composition\n\n\nNixOS achieves its full system configuration by combining the configurations\ndefined in various modules. This composition is primarily handled through the\nimports mechanism.\n\n\nimports: This is a standard option within a NixOS or Home Manager\nconfiguration (often found in your configuration.nix or home.nix). It takes\na list of paths to other Nix modules. When you include a module in the imports\nlist, the options and configurations defined in that module become part of\nyour overall system configuration.\n\n\nYou declaratively state the desired state of your system by setting options\nacross various modules. The NixOS build system then evaluates and merges these\noption settings. The culmination of this process, which includes building the\nentire system closure, is represented by the derivation built by\nconfig.system.build.toplevel.\n\n\nNixOS Modules and Dependency Locking with npins\nThis is the file structure:\n\nThis uses npins for dependency locking.

Think of system.build.toplevel as the very top of the configuration\nhierarchy for your entire NixOS system. Almost every setting you configure\neventually influences this top-level derivation, often through a series of\nintermediate steps.\nKey Takeaway: system.build.toplevel is the ultimate output that defines your entire NixOS system.\nHow Options Relate: A Chain of Influence\nOptions in NixOS are not isolated; they often build upon each other. Here's an example of how a high-level option can lead down to a low-level system configuration:\n\nYou enable Nginx with services.nginx.enable = true;.\nThis setting influences the lower-level option systemd.services.nginx.\nWhich, in turn, affects the even lower-level option\nsystemd.units.\"nginx.service\".\nUltimately, this leads to the creation of a systemd unit file within\nenvironment.etc.\"systemd/system\".\nFinally, this unit file ends up as result/etc/systemd/system/nginx.service\nwithin the final system.build.toplevel derivation.\n\nKey Takeaway: Higher-level, user-friendly options are translated into\nlower-level system configurations that are part of the final system build.\nThe NixOS Module System: Evaluating Options\nSo, how do these options get processed and turned into the final system\nconfiguration? That's the job of the NixOS module system, located in the\n./lib directory of Nixpkgs (specifically in modules.nix, options.nix,\nand types.nix).\nInterestingly, the module system isn't exclusive to NixOS; you can use it to\nmanage option sets in your own Nix projects.\nHere's a simplified example of using the module system outside of NixOS:\n\nYou can evaluate the config.toplevel option from this example using:\n\nKey Takeaway: The NixOS module system is responsible for evaluating and\nmerging option configurations from different modules.\nHow the Module System Works: A Simplified Overview\nThe module system processes a set of \"modules\" through these general steps:\n\n\nImporting Modules: It recursively finds and includes all modules\nspecified in imports = [ ... ]; statements.\n\n\nDeclaring Options: It collects all option declarations defined using\noptions = { ... }; from all the modules and merges them. If the same option\nis declared in multiple modules, the module system handles this\n(details omitted for simplicity).\n\n\nDefining Option Values: For each declared option, it gathers all the\nvalue assignments (defined using config = { ... }; or directly at the top\nlevel if no options or config are present) from all modules and merges\nthem according to the option's defined type.\n\n\n\nImportant Note: Option evaluation is lazy, meaning an option's value is\nonly computed when it's actually needed. It can also depend on the values of\nother options.\n\nKey Takeaway: The module system imports, declares, and then evaluates\noption values from various modules to build the final configuration.\nTop-Level Attributes in a Module: imports, options, and config\nWithin a NixOS module (the files that define parts of your system configuration)\n, the attributes defined directly at the top level of the module's function\nhave specific meanings:\n\n\nimports: This attribute is a list of other module files to include. Their\noptions and configurations will also be part of the evaluation.\n\n\noptions: This attribute is where you declare new configuration options. You\ndefine their type, default value, description, etc., using functions like\nlib.mkOption or lib.mkEnableOption.\n\n\nconfig: This attribute is where you assign values to the options that have\nbeen declared (either in the current module or in imported modules).\n\n\nKey Takeaway: The top-level attributes imports, options, and config\nare the primary ways to structure a NixOS module.\nThe Rule: Move Non-Option Attributes Under config\nIf you define either an options or a config attribute at the top level of\nyour module, any other attributes that are not option declarations must be\nmoved inside the config attribute.\nLet's look at an example of what not to do:\n\nThis will result in the error: error: Module has an unsupported attribute 'appstream' This is caused by introducing a top-level 'config' or 'options' attribute. Add configuration attributes immediately on the top level instead, or move all of them into the explicit 'config' attribute.\nKey Takeaway: When you have options or config at the top level, all\nvalue assignments need to go inside the config block.\nThe Correct Way): Using the config Attribute\nTo fix the previous example, you need to move the value assignments for\nenvironment.systemPackages and appstream.enable inside the config attribute:\n\nNow, Nix knows that you are declaring an option (options.mine.desktop.enable)\nand then setting values for other options (environment.systemPackages,\nappstream.enable) within the config block.\nKey Takeaway: The config attribute is used to define the values of\noptions.\nImplicit config: When options is Absent\nIf your module does not define either options or config at the top level,\nthen any attributes you define directly at the top level are implicitly\ntreated as being part of the config.\nFor example, this is valid:\n\nNix will implicitly understand that environment.systemPackages and\nappstream.enable are configuration settings.\nKey Takeaway: If no explicit options or config are present, top-level\nattributes are automatically considered part of the configuration.\nRemoving an Option: What Happens to config\nEven if you remove the options declaration from a module that has a config\nsection, the config = { environment.systemPackages = ... }; part will still\nfunction correctly, assuming the option it's referencing (appstream.enable\nin this case) is defined elsewhere (e.g., in an imported module).\nKey Takeaway: The config section defines values for options, regardless\nof whether those options are declared in the same module.\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/top-level-attributes/","title":"Understanding Top-Level Attributes in NixOS Modules"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/understanding-package-definitions/":{"body":"Understanding Package Definitions in Nix\nTOC\n\nUnderstanding Package Definitions in Nix\n\nThe Journey from Definition to Package\nSkeleton of a Derivation\nExample: A Simple \"Hello\" Package Definition\n\nSwaytools Package Definition\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Nix, the concept of a package can refer to two things:\n\n\nA collection of files and data that constitute a piece of software or an\nartifact.\n\n\nA Nix expression that describes how to create such a collection. This\nexpression acts as a blueprint before the package exists in a tangible form.\n\n\nThe process begins with writing a package definition using the Nix language.\nThis definition contains the necessary instructions and metadata about the\nsoftware you intend to \"package.\"\nThe Journey from Definition to Package\n\n\nPackage Definition:\n\n\nThis is essentially a function written in the Nix language.\n\n\nNix language shares similarities with JSON but includes the crucial\naddition of functions.\n\n\nIt acts as the blueprint for creating a package.\n\n\n\n\nDerivation:\n\n\nWhen the package definition is evaluated by Nix, it results in\na derivation.\n\n\nA derivation is a concrete and detailed build plan.\n\n\nIt outlines the exact steps Nix needs to take: fetching source code,\nbuilding dependencies, compiling code, and ultimately producing the\ndesired output (the package).\n\n\n\n\nRealization (Building the Package):\n\n\nYou don't get a pre-built \"package\" directly from the definition or the\nderivation.\n\n\nThe package comes into being when Nix executes the derivation. This\nprocess is often referred to as \"realizing\" the derivation.\n\n\n\n\nAnalogy: Think of a package definition as an architectural blueprint, the\nderivation as the detailed construction plan, and the realized package as the\nfinished building.\nSkeleton of a Derivation\nThe most basic derivation structure in Nix looks like this:\n\n\n\nThis is a function that expects an attribute set containing stdenv as its\nargument.\n\n\nIt then calls stdenv.mkDerivation (a function provided by stdenv) to\nproduce a derivation.\n\n\nCurrently, this derivation doesn't specify any build steps or outputs.\n\n\nFurther Reading:\n\n\nThe Standard Environment\n\n\nFundamentals of Stdenv\n\n\nExample: A Simple \"Hello\" Package Definition\nHere's a package definition for the classic \"hello\" program:\n\n\n\nThis is a Nix function that takes stdenv and fetchzip as arguments.\n\n\nIt uses stdenv.mkDerivation to define the build process for the \"hello\"\npackage.\n\n\npname: The package name.\n\n\nversion: The package version.\n\n\nsrc: Specifies how to fetch the source code using fetchzip.\n\n\n\n\nHandling Dependencies: Importing Nixpkgs\n\n\nIf you try to build hello.nix directly with nix-build hello.nix, it will\nfail because stdenv and fetchzip are part of Nixpkgs, which isn't included\nin this isolated file.\n\n\nTo make this package definition work, you need to pass the correct arguments\n(stdenv, fetchzip) to the function.\n\n\nThe recommended approach is to create a default.nix file in the same\ndirectory:\n\n\n\nThis default.nix imports Nixpkgs.\n\n\nIt then uses pkgs.callPackage to call the function in hello.nix, passing\nthe necessary dependencies from Nixpkgs.\n\n\nYou can now build the \"hello\" package using: nix-build -A hello. The\n-A flag tells Nix to build the attribute named hello from the top-level\nexpression in default.nix.\n\n\nRealizing the Derivation and Handling sha256\n\n\nEvaluation vs. Realization: While \"evaluate\" refers to Nix processing an\nexpression, \"realize\" often specifically means building a derivation and\nproducing its output in the Nix store.\n\n\nWhen you first run nix-build -A hello, it will likely fail due to a missing\nsha256 hash for the source file. Nix needs this hash for security and\nreproducibility. The error message will provide the correct sha256 value.\n\n\nExample Error):\n\n\n\n\nReplace the empty sha256 = \"\"; in hello.nix with the provided correct\nvalue: sha256 = \"1kJjhtlsAkpNB7f6tZEs+dbKd8z7KoNHyDHEJ0tmhnc=\";.\n\nBuilding and Running the Result\nAfter updating the sha256, you can successfully build the package:\n\nThe output will be a result symlink pointing to the built package in the Nix\nstore. You can then run the \"hello\" program:\n\nSwaytools Package Definition\nExample: The swaytools Package Definition\nLet's examine a more complex, real-world package definition from Nixpkgs:\nnixpkgs/pkgs/tools/wayland/swaytools/default.nix.\n\nBreakdown of the Above default.nix\n1 Function Structure:\n\nThe file starts with a function taking an attribute set of dependencies from\nNixpkgs: { lib, setuptools, buildPythonApplication, fetchFromGitHub, slurp }\n:.\n\n\nDerivation Creation:\n\n\nIt calls buildPythonApplication, a specialized helper for Python packages\n(similar to stdenv.mkDerivation but pre-configured for Python). The rec\nkeyword allows attributes within the derivation to refer to each other.\n\n\nPackage Metadata:\n\n\n\npname and version define the package's name and version.\n\n\nThe meta attribute provides standard package information like the homepage,\ndescription, license, maintainers, and supported platforms.\n\n\n\nSource Specification:\n\n\nThe src attribute uses fetchFromGitHub to download the source code from\nthe specified repository and revision, along with its sha256 hash for\nverification.\n\n\nBuild and Runtime Dependencies:\n\n\n\nnativeBuildInputs: Lists tools required during the build process (e.g.,\nsetuptools for Python).\n\n\npropagatedBuildInputs: Lists dependencies needed at runtime (e.g., slurp).\n\n\n\nBuild Format:\n\n\nformat = \"pyproject\"; indicates that the package uses a pyproject.toml\nfile for its Python build configuration.\n\nIntegration within Nixpkgs\n\n\nLocation: The swaytools definition resides in\npkgs/tools/wayland/swaytools/default.nix.\n\n\nTop-Level Inclusion: It's made available as a top-level package in\npkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix like this:\n\n\n\n\npython3Packages.callPackage is used here because swaytools is a Python\npackage, and it ensures the necessary Python-related dependencies are\ncorrectly passed to the swaytools definition.\n\nResources\n\nPackaging Existing Software\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/understanding-package-definitions/","title":"Understanding Package Definitions in Nix"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/using-overlays-to-add-packages/":{"body":"Using Overlays to add Packages that aren't in Nixpkgs\nTOC\n\nAdding the overlays output to your Flake\nThe Actual Overlay\nThe pokego Package definition\nAdding the overlay to your configuration\nInstalling Pokego\n\nAnother Overlay Example\n\n\n\n\nIt is very common to use overlays in Nix to install packages that aren't\navailable in the standard Nixpkgs repository.\n\n\nOverlays are one of the primary and recommended ways to extend and customize\nyour Nix environment. It's important to remember that Nix overlays are made to\nallow you to modify or extend the package set provided by Nixpkgs (or other\nNix sources) without directly altering the original package definitions. This\nis crucial for maintaining reproducibility and avoiding conflicts. Overlays\nare essentially functions that take the previous package set and allow you to\nadd, modify, or remove packages.\n\n\nIt may be helpful to first read my\nNixFlakesTips\npost first to understand the outputs in my flake.\n\n\nAdding the overlays output to your Flake\nI'll show the process of adding the pokego package that is not in Nixpkgs:\n\nIn my flake.nix I have a custom inputs variable within my let block of my flake like so just showing the necessary parts for berevity:\n\n\nThe Actual Overlay\n\nIn the overlay.nix I have this helper function and the defined package:\n\n\n\n_final: prev:: This is the function definition of the overlay.\n\n\n\n_final: This argument represents the final, merged package set after all\noverlays have been applied. It's often unused within a single overlay, hence\nthe _ prefix (a Nix convention for unused variables).\n\n\nprev: This is the crucial argument. It represents the package set before\nthis overlay is applied. This allows you to refer to existing packages and\nfunctions from Nixpkgs.\n\n\n\n\nlet ... in packages: This introduces a let expression, which defines\nlocal variables within the scope of this overlay function. The in packages\npart means that the overlay function will ultimately return the packages\nattribute set defined within the let block.\n\n\ncallPackage = prev.lib.callPackageWith (prev // packages): This line\ndefines a helper function called callPackage.\n\n\n\n\nprev.lib.callPackageWith Is a function provided by Nixpkgs' lib.\ncallPackageWith is like prev.lib.callPackage, but allows the passing\nof additional arguments that will then be passed to the package definition.\n\n\n(prev // packages): This is an attribute set merge operation. It takes the\nprev package set (Nixpkgs before this overlay) and merges it with the\npackages attribute set defined later in this overlay.\n\n\nBy using callPackageWith with this merged attribute set, the callPackage\nfunction defined here is set up to correctly import package definitions,\nensuring they have access to both the original Nixpkgs and any other packages\ndefined within this overlay.\n\n\n\n\npackages = { ... };: This defines an attribute set named packages. This\nset will contain all the new or modified packages introduced by this overlay.\n\n\npokego = callPackages ./pac_defs/pokego.nix { };: This is the core of how\nthe pokego package is added.\n\n\n\n\npokego =: This defines a new attribute named pokego within the packages\nattribute set. This name will be used to refer to the pokego package later.\n\n\ncallPackage ./pac_defs/pokego.nix {}: This calls the callPackage helper\nfunction defined earlier.\n\n\n./pac_defs/pokego.nix: This is the path to another Nix file(pokego.nix)\nthat contains the actual package definition for pokego. This file would\ndefine how to fetch, build, and install the pokego software\n\n\n{}: This is an empty attribute set passed as additional arguments to the\npokego.nix package definition. If pokego.nix expected any specific\nparameters (like versions or dependencies), you would provide them here.\nSince it's empty, it implies pokego.nix either has no required arguments or\nuses default values.\n\n\n\nin packages: As mentioned earlier, the overlay function returns the\npackages attribute set. When this overlay is applied, the packages defined\nwithin this packages set (including pokego) will be added to the overall Nix\npackage set.\n\nThe pokego Package definition\nThe following is the ./pac_defs/pokego.nix, it may be helpful to first read my\nPackageDefinition\npost to better understand the following:\n\nAdding the overlay to your configuration\nThere are a few places you could choose to put the following, I choose to use\nmy configuration.nix because of my setup:\n\nInstalling Pokego\n\nIf you are managing your entire system configuration with NixOS, you would\ntypically add pokego to your environment.systemPackages.\n\n\n\nIf you prefer home-manager you can install pokego with home-manager also:\n\n\nAnother Overlay Example\n\n\n\nNormally, pkgs = import nixpkgs { }`` imports Nixpkgs with default settings.  However, the example above customizes this import by passing arguments: pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; overlays = [ nix.overlays.default];}.  This makes the pkgs variable represent nixpkgs specifically for the aarch64-darwin` system, with the overlay from the nix flake applied.\n\n\nConsequently, any packages built using this customized pkgs will now depend\non or use the specific nix version (2.17.0) provided by the nix flake, instead\nof the version that comes with the fetched nixpkgs. This technique can be\nuseful for ensuring a consistent environment or testing specific package\nversions.\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/using-overlays-to-add-packages/","title":"Using Overlays to add Packages that aren't in Nixpkgs"}},"docInfo":{"https://saylesss88.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/building-your-configuration-as-a-package/":{"body":332,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/comparing-flakes-to-traditional-nix/":{"body":309,"title":6},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/conditional-modules/":{"body":132,"title":2},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/declarative-dep-inject/":{"body":391,"title":5},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/functionsexplained/":{"body":481,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/intro-to-jujutsu-vcs/":{"body":311,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/learn-derivations/":{"body":477,"title":6},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/local-nixpkgs/":{"body":733,"title":6},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-explained/":{"body":668,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-tips-and-tricks/":{"body":279,"title":4},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-lang-basics/":{"body":779,"title":5},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-modules-explained/":{"body":583,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-repl-tips/":{"body":187,"title":2},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/overlay-resources/":{"body":29,"title":2},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/simple-service/":{"body":156,"title":6},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/top-level-attributes/":{"body":600,"title":6},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/understanding-package-definitions/":{"body":531,"title":4},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/using-overlays-to-add-packages/":{"body":473,"title":6}},"length":20},"lang":"English"}
