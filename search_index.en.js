workflow. Also I take notes in markdown so this is written in markdown. It demonstrates other ways to modularize your config as well as going into more advanced outputs.\n\n\nThis allows you to build your configuration as a package allowing you to separate the process of creating a configuration artifact and applying it to the live system giving you a reusable artifact that can be used to deploy to different systems. This can make it easier to isolate it from other parts of your system making debugging easier.\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't want to change the name of inputs and effect other areas of my config so I first renamed @ inputs to @ my-inputs to make the merged attribute set use the original inputs name.\n\n\nNote, I'm still using home-manager as a module I just had to move it for all modules to be available inside the artifact built with nix build .#nixos\n\n\nBenefits of nixosConfiguration as a Package\npackages.x86_64-linux.nixos = self.nixosConfigurations.magic.config.system.build.toplevel;\n\nThis exposes the toplevel derivation of nixosConfiguration.magic as a package, which is the complete system closure of your NixOS configuration.\n\nHere is the /hosts/magic/default.nix:\n\n\nBecause we want all modules, not just NixOS modules this requires changing your configuration.nix to include your home-manager configuration. The core reason for this is that the packages.nixos output builds a NixOS system, and home-manager needs to be a part of that system's definition to be included in the build.\n\n\n\n[!NOTE]: inputs.lib.nixOsModules is equivalent to ../../home in my case and imports all of my nixOS modules. This comes from the flake.nix where I have nixOsModules = import ./nixos Which looks for a default.nix in the nixos directory.\n\nMy ~/my-nixos/nixos/default.nix looks like this:\n\nUsage and Deployment\nTo build the package configuration run:\n\nAdding a Configuration VM Output\nBuilding on what we already have, add this under defaultConfig:\n\nand under the line nixos = defaultConfig.config.system.build.toplevel add:\n\nAnd in lib/vms/nixos-vm.nix:\n\n\nUncomment and add your username to auto login.\n\nAnd an apps output that will build and deploy in one step with nix build .#deploy-nixos I'll show packages and apps outputs for context:\n\nDebugging\n\nBefore switching configurations, verify what's inside your built package:\n\n\n\nExplore the Package Contents\n\nOnce the build completes, you get a store path like /nix/store/...-nixos-system.

This doesn't follow exactly but I put it together in a way I found easier to follow, it's long but has a lot of great insights for learning more about how NixOS works. It mainly compares how to get pure build results from both Traditional Nix and Flakes.\nOne of the primary benefits of Nix Flakes is their default enforcement of pure evaluation, leading to more reproducible and predictable builds. In Nix, an impure operation or value depends on something outside of the explicit inputs provided to the build process. This could include things like the user's system configuration, environment variables, or the current time. Impurity can lead to builds that produce different results on different systems or at different times, undermining reproducibility.\nIn this section, we will compare how Flakes and traditional Nix handle purity and demonstrate the steps involved in building a simple hello package using both methods.\nWe'll start by creating a hello directory:\n\nnow create a flake.nix:\n\n\n\nVersion control is recommended and required for certain sections of this. In the video he does all of this in the same directory which I think complicates things so I recommend using separate directories.\n\n\nIn flakes there is no access to builtins.currentSystem so you have to implicitly add it. Commands like this and builtins.getEnv \"USER are impure because they depend on the current system which can be different from user to user.\n\n\nFlakes enable pure evaluation mode by default, so with our flake as is running:\n\n\nnix build .#myHello will fail.\nTo get around this you can pass:\n\nLet's explore some ways to make this flake build purely.\nTo do this we need to add the system attribute (i.e. x86_64-linux) with your current system, flake-utils simplifies making flakes system agnostic:\n\nThis will allow it to successfully build with nix build .#myHello because flake-utils provides the system attribute.\nTraditional Nix\nCreate another directory named hello2 and a default.nix with the following contents:\n\nBuild it with:\n\nWe can see that it's impure with the nix repl:\n\n\n\nThe output is the path to the nixpkgs channel and impure because it can be different between users, it depends on the environment\n\n\nEven if you have channels disabled like I do because I use flakes you get an output like this: /nix/store/n5xdr9b74ni7iiqgbcv636a6d4ywfhbn-source. This is still impure because it still represents a dependency on something external to your current Nix expression. It relies on a specific version of Nixpkgs being present in the store, if it's not available it will fail.\n\n\nGitHub's Role in Reproducibility: GitHub, and similar Git hosting platforms, provide a valuable feature: the ability to download archives (tar.gz or zip files) of a repository at a specific commit hash. This is incredibly important for reproducibility in Nix. By fetching Nixpkgs (or any other Git-based Nix dependency) as a tarball from a specific commit, you ensure that you are using a precise and immutable snapshot of the code. This eliminates the uncertainty associated with channels that can be updated.\n\n\nWe want to use the same revision for traditional nix for nixpkgs as we did for our nix flake. To do so you can get the revision # from the flake.lock file in our hello directory. You could cd to the hello directory and run cat flake.lock and look for:\n\n\nYou have to add the revision number and add .tar.gz to the end of it. Also remove the &lt;&gt; around nixpkgs like so removing the impurity of using a registry lookup path so back in the hello2 directory in the default.nix:\n\n\n\nAnd finally, we don't know the correct sha256 yet so we use a placeholder like so:\n\n\n\nYou enter a placeholder for the sha256, after you run:\nnix-build -A myHello Nix will give you the correct hash to replace the zeros.\n\nYou can see that they produce the same result by running:\n\n\nIn the hello directory with the flake.nix run ls -al and looking at the result symlink path.\n\n\nNow in the hello2 directory with the default.nix run nix-build -A myHello the result will be the same path as the symlink above.\n\n\nIn default.nix there is still an impurity, the \"system\" and actually more.\n\n\nNixpkgs has 3 default arguments that people care about, i.e. when using (import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {}):\n\n\noverlays, by default ~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays. The existance and contents of this directory are dependent on the individual user's system configuration. Different users may have different overlays defined, or none at all. This means that the effective set of packages available when you import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; can vary from one user to another, making builds non-reproducible.\n\n\nconfig, by default ~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix. This allows users to set various Nixpkgs options like enabling or disabling features.\n\n\nsystem, by default builtins.currentSystem. This is impure because the same Nix expression built on different machines (with different operating systems or architectures) will use a different system value, potentially leading to different build outputs or even build failures.\n\n\n\n\nAnd they all have defaults that are impure.\nUsers have problems because they don't realize that defaults are pulled in and they have some overlays and config.nix that are custom to their setup. This can't happen in flakes because they enforces this. We can override this by passing empty lists and attribute sets and a system argument to the top-level function with a default like so:\n\n\n\nWe want to be able to change the system even if we're on a different one, what typically is done is having a system argument to the top-level function like above.\n\n\nThe main expression is pure now but the top-level function is still impure, but we can override it with the following:\n\n\nif you import this file from somewhere else:\nimport ./default.nix { system = \"x86_64-linux\"; }\nor from the cli:\n\nor if you already have the path in your store you can try to build it with:\n\n\n\nIt's called --check because it builds it again and then checks if the results are in the same path.\n\n\nYou can also use pure evaluation mode in the old nix commands:\n\n\nGet the rev from git log:\n\nOutput: { lastModified = 1746377457; lastModifiedDate = \"20250504165057\"; narHash = \"sha256-K6CRWIeVxTobxvGtfXl7jvLc4vcVVftOZVD0zBaz3i8=\"; outPath = \"/nix/store/rqq60nk6zsp0rknnnagkr0q9xgns98m7-source\"; rev = \"b4fe677e255c6f89c9a6fdd3ddd9319b0982b1ad\"; revCount = 1; shortRev = \"b4fe677\"; submodules = false; }\n\nThe outPath is how you evaluate derivations to path:\n\n\n\n\nThis shows how derivations get interpolated into strings.\n\n\nNow we can build the actual derivation with this, first run git log to get the commit hash:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see this is very inconvenient, also every time you make a change you have to commit it again to get a new revision we also need to interpolate the string to get the revision into the string. Near the end I mention some tools that make working with traditional nix with pure evaluation easier.\n\nBack to Flakes\nIf we want to build the flake with a different Nixpkgs:\n\nWe can't really do this with our default.nix because it's hard-coded within a\nlet statement.\nA common way around this is to write another argument which is nixpkgs:\n\nBuild it:\n\nor\n\n\narg provides a nix value as an argument, argstr turns a given string into a nix argument. Here we're not using pure evaluation mode for a temp override.\n\nOr another impure command that you can add purity aspects to, Traditional Nix\nhas a lot of impurities by default but in almost all cases you can make it pure:\n\nUpdate the Nixpkgs version in flakes\n\n\nDoing this with Traditional Nix is pretty easy with niv:\n\n\nThis creates a nix/ directory with a sources.json (lockfile) &amp; sources.nix (a big file managed by niv to do the import correctly).\n\nIn our default.nix:\n\nBuild it:\n\nniv can do much more, you can add a dependency with github owner and repo:\n\n\n\nuse niv drop to remove dependencies.\n\n\nUpdate nixpkgs:\n\n\n\nThe flake and default.nix are both using the same store object:\n\n\nniv only relies on stable NixOS features, can be used for automatic source\nupdates. They do the source tracking recursively,\n\nAdding Home-Manager\nFlakes:\n\n\n\n\nFlakes have a standard structure that Traditional Nix never had, the flake\nprovides a default package, nixosModules, packages for different architectures,and templates. Pretty convenient.\n\n\nIf you look at your flake.lock you'll see that home-manager was added as\nwell as another nixpkgs.\n\n\nTraditional Nix:\n\n\nWe can follow the outPath and see that there's a default.nix, flake.nix,\nflake.lock and much more. In the default.nix you'll see a section for docs.\n\nHome-manager has a .outPath that it uses by default which is a function,\nand Nix uses the default.nix by default.\n\nIf we want to build the docs go back to our default.nix:\n\nBuild it:\n\nWith the flake.nix to do this you would add:\n\nBuild it:\n\n\nTo have home-manager use the same Nixpkgs as your flake inputs you can add\nthis under the home-manager input:\n\nhome-manager.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = \"nixpkgs\";\n\nI put this together from a nix-hour comparing flakes to traditional Nix.\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/comparing-flakes-to-traditional-nix/","title":"Comparing Nix Flakes to Traditional Nix"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/conditional-modules/":{"body":"Conditional Configuration\nWith options it's easy to conditionally install something based on if another program is enabled in your configuration.\nFor example, if I have an option to enable or disable hyprland like this:\n\n\n\nSince the above module is set to false, it is necessary to add custom.hyprland.enable = true to my home.nix to have Nix add it to my configuration.

This means wlogout is enabled by default only if Hyprland is enabled, but I can override this (e.g., custom.wlogout.enable = true without Hyprland). This conditional logic prevents wlogout from being installed unnecessarily when Hyprland is disabled, unlike a simpler approach like programs.wlogout.enable = config.programs.hyprland.enable, which hardcodes the dependency and offers less flexibility.\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/conditional-modules/","title":"Conditional Configuration"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/declarative-dependency-injection/":{"body":"Injecting Dependencies into Modules from a Flake\n\n\nIn my last post I touched on specialArgs and extraSpecialArgs being ways to inject dependencies and variables from flakes to modules, this is another way to inject dependencies. specialArgs dumps values directly into every module's argument list, which breaks the usual declarative data flow model of NixOS. Instead of passing dependencies explicitly, your modules suddenly receive extra variables that aren't structured like normal module options.\nFirst we'll define a custom option in an inline module that has the needed dependencies in its lexical closure inside of flake.nix to inject said dependencies into our NixOS configuration. This makes those dependencies available to all modules that import this configuration, without needing to pass them explicitly via specialArgs in your flakes outputs. It's a more declarative and centralized way to share dependencies across modules.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis defines a reusable NixOS module (nixosModules.default) that creates a dep-inject option and sets it to include your flakes inputs. It automates the process of passing inputs to individual modules in your nixosConfigurations\n\n\nThis allows you to access these dependencies directly from config.dep-inject, without the need to explicitly declare them in their argument list (e.g.\n{ inputs, pkgs, lib, ... }) and promotes a more declarative approach moving away from the imperative step of explicitly passing arguments everywhere.\n\n\nThe depInject module becomes a reusable component that any NixOS configuration within your flake can import this module automatically and gain access to the injected dependencies.\n\n\nExample use:\n\nUse dep-inject in any Module\n\nIn any module that's part of this configuration, you can access the injected dependencies via config.dep-inject. You don't need to add inputs or userVars to the module's arguments.\n\nExample: System Configuration Module\n\n\n\nconfig.dep-inject.flake-inputs.nixpkgs: Accesses the nixpkgs input\n\n\nconfig.dep-inject.userVars: Access your userVars\n\n\nUnlike specialArgs, you don't need { inputs, userVars, ... }\n\n\nUse dep-inject in home-manager modules\n\n\nBy default, dep-inject is available in NixOS modules but not automatically in home-manager modules unless you either:\n\nPass dep-inject via extraSpecialArgs (less ideal)\nor\nImport the depInject module into home-managers configuration.\n\n\n\n\nUsing extraSpecialArgs\n\n\nThen in ./hosts/${host}/home.nix:\n\n\nImport depInject into home-manager:\n\n\n\n\nimports = [ self.nixosModules.default ]: Makes dep-inject available in home-managers config.\n\n\nAccess: Use config.dep-inject directly in home-manager modules, no extraSpecialArgs needed.\n\n\nThis is considered more idiomatic and as mentioned in \"flakes-arent-real\" linked below, specialArgs is uglier, since it gets dumped into the arguments for every module, which is unlike how every other bit of data flow works in NixOS, and it also doesn't work outside of the flake that's actually invoking nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem, if you try using modules outside of that particular Flake, the injected arguments won't persist.\n\n\nBy explicitly handling dependency injection in a more declarative way (e.g. config.dep-inject), you ensure that dependencies remain accessible accross different modules, regardless of where they are used.\n\n\nI got this example from flakes-arent-real and built on it to enhance understanding.

Some top-level attributes are inputs, outputs, and nixConfig.\n\n\nFlake commands are space separation for subcommands like this: nix build, the older cli commands are written with a hyphen nix-build.\n\n\nBasic Flake Structure:\n\n\nThe flake.nix file must contain an attribute set with one required attribute - outputs - and optionally description and inputs.\n\nInputs\n\n\nYou can think of inputs as the dependencies this flake relies on.\n\n\ninputs: An attribute set specifying the dependencies of the flake where the keys are the names of your flakes dependencies, and the values are references to those other flakes. To access something from a dependency, you would typically go through inputs (i.e. inputs.helix.packages)\n\n\nThe following specifies a dependency on the nixpkgs and import-cargo repositories:\n\n\n\nEach input is fetched, evaluated and passed to the outputs function as a set of attributes with the same name as the corresponding input.\n\n\nThe special input self refers to the outputs and source tree of this flake.\n\n\nEach input is fetched, evaluated and passed to the outputs function as a set of attributes with the same name as the corresponding input.\n\n\n\n\nOutputs\n\n\nYou can think of outputs as the things your flake provides (i.e. Your configuration, packages, devShells, derivations)\n\n\nFlakes can provide arbitrary Nix values, such as packages, NixOS modules or library functions. These are called outputs. Some outputs have special meaning to certain Nix commands and therefore must be a specific type. If you look at the output schema you'll see that most expect a derivation\n\n\nShow your flakes outputs with:\n\nThis command actually takes a flake URI and prints all the outputs of the flake as a nice tree structure, mapping attribute paths to the types of values.\n\n\nBeginners might initially think that self and nixpkgs within the outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... } definition are the 'outputs' themselves. However, these are actually the input arguments (which are often called output arguments) to the outputs function. This distinction is key to grasping the outputs of a flake.\n\n\nRemember that the outputs function itself takes a single argument, which is an attribute set. Even though it looks like multiple arguments { self, nixpkgs, ... }, this syntax in Nix is destructuring that single input attribute set to extract its individual fields.\n\n\nself is a way to reference \"this\" flake. You could use self.inputs to access the inputs top-level attribute. The outputs function always receives an argument conventionally named self. This argument is a reference to the flake itself including all of it's top-level attributes. You typically use self to refer to things within your own flake. (i.e. self.packages.my-package)\n\n\n\n[!NOTE]: The ... syntax is for variadic attributes, (i.e. a varying number of attributes). If you notice most flakes have many more inputs than are explicitly listed in the input arguments this is possible because of variadic attributes.\n\nIn the following example c = 2 is an extra attribute:\n\nHowever, in the function body you cannot access the \"c\" attribute. The solution is to give a name to the given set with the @-pattern:\n\n\n\n@-patterns in the outputs function argument list provides a convenient way to bind the entire attribute set to a name (i.e. outputs = { pkgs, ... } @ inputs).\n\n\nWhen you write outputs = { pkgs, ... } @ inputs, it does the following:\n\n\nDestructures the input attribute set: It tries to extract the value associated with the key pkgs from the input attribute set and bind it to the variable pkgs. The ... allows for other keys in the input attr set to be ignored in this direct destructuring.\n\n\nBinds the entire attribute set to inputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlakes promise that the outputs of a flake should be the same regardless of the evaluator's environment. Because of this, all flake outputs that have anything to do with packages must specify the platform explicitly in some way.\n\n\nPlatform is a combination of architecture and OS. (e.g. x86_64-linux).\n\n\nlegacyPackages is designed specifically for nixpkgs. It makes it possible to work with nixpkgs arbitrary attribute format from older packages. What this means is that nixpkgs traditionally organizes packages directly under the top level (e.g. pkgs.hello), and legacyPackages provides a consistent platform-aware way to access these within the flake's structured output format.\n\n\nTo expand further, Flakes enforce a more structured way of organizing outputs. For package outputs, the expected schema typically has the platform specification as a top-level attribute (i.e. packages.x86_64-linux.my-package). This ensures that when you ask a flake for a package, it's clear which platform the package is intended for. It's kind of like an API for flakes and legacy packages to be able to work together.\n\n\n\n\nFlakes take a sole argument which is another point of confusion, how is it a sole argument if im passing { self, nixpkgs, ... }? This syntax is actually shorthand for a single argument that is an attribute set.\n\nRemember, a valid attribute set in nix is {}. { a = 1; } is an attribute set with a single value. An attribute set is simply a set of name value pairs wrapped in curly braces.(e.g. {self, nixpkgs, ... }). Notice also that in the inputs arguments commas are used and everywhere else uses semicolon ;\n\n\n\nOutputs (of the Flake): Refers to the attribute set that is returned by the outputs function.\n\n\nTo recap the outputs function takes an attribute set as its argument and returns an attribute set.\n\n\nI already covered that nixosConfigurations outputs your NixOS configuration, there can be many other types of outputs explained below.\n\n\nImports\n\n\nYou can think of import as \"evaluate the Nix expression in this file\" and return its value.\n\n\nThe import function in Nix takes a path (usually a string representating a file or directory i.e. ./lib/dev-shell.nix) and evaluates the Nix expression found at that location.\n\n\nOne point of confusion is the following:\n\n\n\n\nWith (import ./modules/desktop.nix { pkgs = nixpkgs; }) you're actually saying import the file at this location but also export nixpkgs to said file to make it available.\n\nWhen you see:\n\nYou are:\n\n\nImporting the Nix expression from ./lib/my-helpers.nix\n\n\nPassing an attribute set { pkgs = nixpkgs; } as an argument to the evaluated expression in the imported file.\n\n\nInside lib/my-helpers.nix, there will likely be a function definiton that expects an argument (often also named pkgs by convention):\n\n\n\nBy passing { pkgs = nixpkgs; } during the import, you are essentially saying: The pkgs that the code in ./lib/my-helpers.nix expects as an argument should be the nixpkgs that is available within the scope of my current flake.nix(the nixpkgs passed as an argument to the outputs function)\n\n\nWhen you use import with a path that points to a directory, Nix doesn't just try to import the directory itself (which wouldn't make sense as a Nix value). Instead, it automatically looks for a file named default.nix within that directory.\n\n\nIf a default.nix file is found inside the specified directory, Nix will then evaluate the Nix expressions within that default.nix file, just as if you had directly specified the path to default.nix in your import statement. The result of evaluating default.nix becomes the value returned by the import function.\n\n\nResources\n\n\npractical-nix-flakes\n\n\ntweag nix-flakes\n\n\nNixOS-wiki Flakes\n\n\nnix.dev flakes\n\n\nflakes-arent-real\n\n\nwombats-book-of-nix\n\n\nzero-to-nix flakes\n\n\nnixos-and-flakes-book\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-explained/","title":"Nix Flakes Explained"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-tips-and-tricks/":{"body":"Nix Flake Tips and Tricks\n\nShallow clone nixpkgs, the full Git history isn't always necessary and this can speed up build times.\n\n\nThe only issue I've had is nix-index-database not working well with the shallow clone...

Values aren't known in advance: the names are placeholders that are filled when calling the function.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nIn the above example personName is a placeholder (the argument name).\n\n\nThe actual value for personName is provided when you call the function:\n\n\n\nFunction Declarations\n\nSingle argument\n\n\n\n\nMultiple arguments via nesting (currying)\n\n\nCurrying is the process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each taking a single argument.\n\n\n\n\nNix sees the colons as separators for single-argument functions that return other functions.\n\n\nThink of this as a chain of single-argument functions:\n\nOuter Function: prefix: (name: \"${prefix}, ${name}!\")\n\n\n\nThis function takes one argument, prefix.\n\n\nIts body is the definition of another function.\n\n\n\nInner Function: name: \"${prefix}, ${name}!\"\n\n\n\nThis function (which is the result of the outer function) takes one argument, name.\n\n\nIts body is the string interpolation, which can still access the prefix from the outer function's scope.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Evaluation of this Multi-Argument Call:\nWhen you write greeting \"Hello\" \"Alice\", Nix evaluates it like this:\n\ngreeting \"Hello\"\n\n\n\nThe greeting function is called with the argument \"Hello\".\n\n\nThe outer function prefix: ... is executed, with prefix being assigned \"Hello\".\n\n\nThe result of this execution is the inner function: name: \"Hello, ${name}!\"\n\n\n\n(greeting \"Hello\") \"Alice\":\n\n\n\nThe result of the first step (the inner function) is now called with the argument \"Alice\".\n\n\nThe inner function name: \"Hello, ${name}!\" is executed, with name being assigned \"Alice\".\n\n\nThe body \"Hello, ${name}!\" is evaluated, resulting in \"Hello, Alice!\"\n\n\n\nEvery colon you see in a function definition separates a single argument (on its left) from its corresponding function body (on its right). Even when the body is another function definition.\n\n\n\nIn x: x + 1: One argument x, One colon, &amp; one body x + 1\n\n\nIn prefix: name: \"${prefix}, ${name}!\": The first colon separates prefix from the rest (name: \"${prefix}, ${name}!\"), which is the body of the first function. The second colon separates name (the argument of the inner function) from its body (\"${prefix}, ${name}!\").\n\n\nPartial Application\nBecause Nix functions are curried, you can apply arguments one at a time. This is known as partial application. When you apply a function to some, but not all, of its expected arguments, you get a new function that \"remembers\" the arguments you've already provided and is waiting for the remaining ones.\nRevisiting our greeting function:\n\nIf we only provide the prefix:\n\n\nhelloGreeting is a new function that partially applies our greeting function. This new function only requires a single argument.\n\n\n\n\nPartial application can be used for creating specialized functions. This allows you to create more specific functions from more general ones by fixing some of their arguments.\n\n\nMany higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments, like map or filter) expect functions with a specific number of arguments. Partial application allows you to adapt existing functions to fit these expectations by pre-filling some of their parameters.\n\n\nMost NixOS and home-manager modules are actually functions\nIt's important to recognize that the function paradigm is central to how NixOS and Home Manager modules are structured. Most NixOS and Home Manager modules are fundamentally functions.\n\nThese module functions typically accept a single argument, an attribute set.\n\nFor example, a simplified service module could be:\n\n\n\nHere, the entire module is a function that takes one argument: { config, lib, pkgs, ... }.\n\n\nWhen you add this module to your configuration, the module system calls this function with a specific attribute set containing the current configuration, the Nix library (lib), the available packages (pkgs), and other relevant info.\n\n\nResources\n\n\nnix.dev Nix Lang Basics\n\n\nnix pills Functions and Imports\n\n\nzero-to-nix Nix Lang\n\n\nA tour of Nix \"Functions\"\n\n\nlearn Nix in y minutes\n\n\nnoogle function library\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-functions-explained/","title":"Nix Functions Explained"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-lang-basics/":{"body":"The Nix Language\nNix as a programming language can be thought of as a kind of \"JSON, but with\nfunctions\".\nAll statements are declarative, meaning that there's no sequential flow of\ninstructions that makes up a Nix package.

I take notes in markdown so it's written in markdown (sorry old reddit). I write about things to deepen understanding, you think you know until you try to explain it to someone. Anyways, I hope this is useful.\n\nMost modules are functions that take an attribute set and return an attribute set.\n\nRefresher:\n\nAn attribute set is a collection of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces:\n\n\n\nA function with an attribute set argument:\n\n\n\nThe simplest possible NixOS Module:\n\n\nNixOS produces a full system configuration by combining smaller, more isolated and reusable components: Modules. In my opinion modules are one of the first things you should understand when learning about NixOS.\n\n\nA NixOS module defines configuration options and behaviors for system components, allowing users to extend, customize, and compose configurations declaratively.\n\n\nA module is a file containing a Nix expression with a specific structure. It declares options for other modules to define (give a value). Modules were introduced to allow extending NixOS without modifying its source code.\n\n\nTo define any values, the module system first has to know which ones are allowed. This is done by declaring options that specify which attributes can be set and used elsewhere.\n\n\nIf you want to write your own modules, I recommend setting up nixd or nil with your editor of choice. This will allow your editor to warn you about missing arguments and dependencies as well as syntax errors.\n\n\nDeclaring Options\nThe following is nixpkgs/nixos/modules/programs/vim.nix:\n\n\nIt provides options to enable Vim, set it as the default editor, and specify the Vim package to use.\n\n\nModule Inputs and Structure:\n\n\n\n\nInputs: The module takes the above inputs and ... (catch-all for other args)\n\n\nconfig: Allows the module to read option values (e.g. config.programs.vim.enable). It provides access to the evaluated configuration.\n\n\nlib: The Nixpkgs library, giving us helper functions like mkEnableOption, mkIf, and mkOverride.\n\n\npkgs: The Nixpkgs package set, used to access packages like pkgs.vim\n\n\n...: Allows the module to accept additional arguments, making it flexible for extension in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways: A NixOS module is typically a function that can include config, lib, and pkgs, but it doesn’t require them. The ... argument ensures flexibility, allowing a module to accept extra inputs without breaking future compatibility. Using lib simplifies handling options (mkEnableOption, mkIf, mkOverride) and helps follow best practices. Modules define options, which users can set in their configuration, and config, which applies changes based on those options.\n\n\nLocal Configuration Reference:\n\n\n\nThis is a local alias. Instead of typing config.programs.vim over and over, the module uses cfg.\n\n\nOption Declaration\n\n\nThis defines three user-configurable options:\n\n\nenable: Turns on Vim support system-wide.\n\n\ndefaultEditor: Sets Vim as the system's default $EDITOR.\n\n\npackage: lets the user override which Vim package is used.\n\n\n\nmkPackageOption is a helper that defines a package-typed option with a default (pkgs.vim) and provides docs + example.\n\n\nConditional Configuration\n\n\n\nThis block is only activated if either programs.vim.enable or defaultEditor is set.\n\n\nWarnings\n\n\n\nGives you a soft warning if you try to set defaultEditor = true without also enabling Vim.\n\n\nActual System Config Changes\n\n\n\nIt adds Vim to your systemPackages, sets $EDITOR if defaultEditor is true, and makes /share/vim-plugins available in the environment.\n\nThe following is a bat home-manager module that I wrote:\n\nNow I could add this to my home.nix to enable it:\n\n\n\nIf I set this option to true the bat configuration is dropped in place. If it's not set to true, it won't put the bat configuration in the system. Same as with options defined in modules within the Nixpkgs repository.\n\n\nIf I had set the default to true, it would automatically enable the module without requiring an explicit custom.batModule.enable = true; call in my home.nix.\n\n\nModule Composition\n\n\nNixOS achieves its full system configuration by combining the configurations defined in various modules. This composition is primarily handled through the imports mechanism.\n\n\nimports: This is a standard option within a NixOS or Home Manager configuration (often found in your configuration.nix or home.nix). It takes a list of paths to other Nix modules. When you include a module in the imports list, the options and configurations defined in that module become part of your overall system configuration.\n\n\nYou declaratively state the desired state of your system by setting options across various modules. The NixOS build system then evaluates and merges these option settings. The culmination of this process, which includes building the entire system closure, is represented by the derivation built by config.system.build.toplevel.\n\n\nResources on Modules\n\n\nxeiaso Nixos Modules for fun &amp; profit\n\n\nNixOS Wiki NixOS modules\n\n\nnix.dev Module System\n\n\nnix.dev A basic module\n\n\nNixOS Flakes Book Module System\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-modules-explained/","title":"NixOS Modules Explained"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-repl-tips/":{"body":"Nix Repl\nList available commands with :?:\n\nLoad directly Nix expressions\nYou can quickly evaluate a random Nix expression:\n\n\nThe --expr flag is helpful to prime directly the Nix REPL with valuable data\nor values.\n\nLoad Flakes\nWe can use the --expr flag to load a random Nix Flake directly:\n\nAlso, you can load a flake directly inside the REPL with :load-flake or :lf:\n\nDebugging with a Flake REPL output\n\nOne way to do this is to launch the repl with nix repl and inside the repl type :lf /path/to/flake.
